[{"name": "Product_Team_Meeting_-_2019-07-09_-_GitLab_Unfiltered.mp3", "transcript": " Okay, if it's like my family, I definitely have no subjects. Hey Daniel, hey Eric. Hello, welcome back, Eric. Thanks so much. Yeah, it's great to be here. Hi Virginia. No. Alright, let's let's kick off. I wanted to start out with some reminders. First, we have a book club coming up on inspired in four weeks. On August 7th, I just re-read it myself. It's, uh, to good read. It's highly aligned with how I think about product management and does a good job of explaining why some of these things are important. Uh, that, that I also believed to be important. So it's nice to have another voice explaining all of that. So please do read that. I think I'm going to update the new hire on boarding dock and ask all new hires to read this as well so that we all, everybody in the team is on the same page with respect to this book. Let's see, uh, reminder B, remember there's this interview spreadsheet, CS and sales have populated that with the number of customer contacts for meetings. Please do follow up on that. I want to ensure goodwill with that team and follow up promptly with meetings with these customers so that that team can see that we're taking advantage of it. Third reminder, we've got a little engagement survey. I'm going to run this once a month in Q3. Just to take a pulse given all the change going on, please do take a minute to fill it out. It's five you know, quick questions and then one free form where you can share whatever feedback you have. Fabian didn't receive it. I'm pretty sure I went through my emails. I think maybe it's on my end, but I'm happy to fill it out. But I, I didn't get it. Need to get it to. All right, I will, I'll ask Jessica to recent that to you. Anybody else in the same condition where you did not receive it? I don't recall, but is there a way to put the link to the survey in the agenda? Well, it's, it's personal. It's, uh, it's tied back to your user ID so we can track, uh, which team are on in that kind of thing. I do believe it's anonymous, but nevertheless, everyone has their own custom ID. So I'll ask Jessica to send it to Fabian and corona. Anybody else? So I just, I hadn't seen it in Scott, but I searched my email real quick. And it looks like that's the title of the email. So if you just searched for that near your email, you should be able to find it. If you got it. Paul's survey. Culture ramp. Okay. Anybody else didn't get it? Please ping me. All right. Next reminder, we, uh, we need, we have a goal of at least three customer interviews per PM. There's an OKR issue out there. If you haven't updated it lately, please do so. And remember, we have three weeks until Q2 to hit our goals. The please, uh, please do invest the time to get those set up and get at least three done if you haven't already. Uh, next one category maturity page last week. We talked about this Josh did a great job of creating some new views. Uh, one of which is sort of this flow chart showing how mature we're going to be at a given point in time, which raised questions about whether we were forecasting that accurately. If you haven't already, please go in and either confirm that it's accurate or updated. Thanks to Kenny for creating that issue. Uh, somebody added direction maturity page. You want to talk about that? Well, I would just mean just as you, your offensive, so I was adding the link there. That's also folks. It's seen the updates there for the charts. I just checked it out. Um, so got it. So it's a good way you can give a sense for like, you know, it's hard. It's hard when it's in tabular form, but when it's charted, it's much easier to see. Like if it's achievable or not, uh, based on some of the trends. Um, and there's also fiscal down, uh, stays level trends as well. So you can see how your stage in particular is trending or essentially trending. So. Great. Thanks, Josh. All right. Some team updates. We hired a couple more PMs. We got a good rhythm going on hiring. Uh, we hired Gabe Weaver. He originally came through the growth funnel. Uh, but we have a really strong candidate for that fourth slot. So we're going to target Gabe for a third managed PM. The chart or that team is to be defined, but bottom line. We're going to have a third group in the managed area and Gabe will lead that and then dove her schivitz. We just hired him as the, uh, APM monitoring. He's got a great background in monitoring and that's most recently been elastic. So thank you to everyone who's been involved in the hiring loop. I know it's taking a lot of energy from everybody, but uh, I think our hiring processes continues to pick up speed. Uh, B to be, uh, worked with with Christy and David Sakamoto to change in language around customer results. Just want to make sure you all saw that. Uh, so there's the MR. It's got on that one. I just the, uh, there's a, the diff highlights what is new content. I believe and there's one section that is great. I can totally understand why we're at that about prioritized ruthlessly. But then the rest is, I guess a bunch of formatting changes and I don't know if there's new content in any of the dog feeding. I guess the TLDR, the addition of that prioritized ruthlessly or is there some other, uh, point where you're trying to make in this change. Oh, it's been a little while. I think, uh, there were a number of changes. But before the handback basically read that internal feedback is worth 10 times more than external feedback. And I understand why we want internal feedback because of dog fooding and using our own product. It's, it's a, it's a, it's a great channel for feedback. But I think it was sending the message that customers weren't nearly as important as internal opinion. And both Christy and I want to move off of that position. Like, we should be customer first and treat our own teams as a customer. But let's, I don't, I don't want people to interpret that our own internal opinion is worth 10 times more than a customer's opinion if that makes sense. So it is mostly language wherever that showed up in the handbook. Catch it. Okay. The one comment I had on this is that some of the text seems like we should focus on core competencies as opposed to new scope. And like as in the, we should focus for what we're better at. So I might, anyways, let that's one thought I had in this. I don't remember that being the point of it. Maybe it reads that way out. And I feel free to continue to suggest tweaks. The point was let's prioritize and do what matters most first. Just it's kind of what I've been preaching the whole time. Like, let's in your area wherever that is, do what matters first. Don't try to do it all. At once, we're going to have to work our way through. That was the point. Yeah. And I don't know if this is a follow up issue in the way you described it. It doesn't seem controversial. But I will say there was a big discussion and a recent initiative from said in other leaders that we should heavily prioritize dog fooding because there were parts there are teams within the company that were not utilizing our features. And we wanted to make sure that the product team was responsive to requests from them. Yeah. It's a little bit different than saying it's about our internal opinion. Like, we should, we had always said we should validate it. So that clarification is good that we want to make sure it's about us saying this is in line with where we want to take the product and where we're here in customers. But if the internal customer wants it, we should, we should, uh, original thinking was that we should emphasize it. Um, I just want to like, if the intent was to make sure we, we're just clarifying that same position. But if we're saying, actually, we should kind of pull back from the push for more dog fitting. No, maybe different. I would, please don't conflate the two. Okay. Uh, we very much still want to dog food. I think the point is, when you're thinking of customers for your thing, think of our internal teams early. Like, you can get great feedback from them. They have an incentive to work with you. There's very little risk in rolling out things early to them. So treat them like a customer and think of our internal teams early as you're rolling something out. That's still very much the message. But let's not over rotate on internal feedback or internal opinion. Let's still seek external feedback too, because that's just one customer of many cool. Okay. Makes sense. Okay. Yeah. It does. All right. Two C customer training discovery training coming soon. Sarah O'Donnell and her team are going to do a bunch of sort of quick videos on a variety of customer discovery topics. So super excited for that. They should start dropping any day now. I think starting this week. And so we'll release those two as they come out. We'll embed them in the, uh, how we work description on our team page as well. All right. Number three, 12, two, kick off feedback. Josh, thanks for leaving the charge. I thought you did a good job of MCing and sort of adding color commentary in between. I thought the screenshots definitely helped. There were a bunch that did not have them. I was wondering why is it just because we're not there yet on many of these? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, some of the commentary I don't know, or Nicole added that. Yeah. Many of the issues we're saying we're going to do UX front end and back end in the same iteration. So it hasn't started. And in some, like, I can think of a number of where they're just aren't appropriate screenshots or at least there weren't screenshots, uh, or mockups created in advance. Okay. For the purposes of front end working on it because front end was going to work on it with that of a mock up. Okay. I love to get to where we're a bit ahead. So we'll have more of these earlier and hopefully the customer discovery flow will get us further ahead on that. In my case, some of the features also just have no UX component as a no UI component that could be speech-otted. It's, uh, I understand. Yeah. I don't expect everyone. I mean, user judgment, if it doesn't need it, fine. But where we do need design, it'd be great to get at least a month ahead. So as we roll into dev, we have that to offer them. Scott, just a quick question to you. How do you feel about presenting like balsamic or super low-fi mockups on the kickoff call? Fine with that. Okay. That could be an option too for PMs that are waiting for UX or at the same sprint. And I know that plans done a pretty good job at, um, at least in the past of kind of running ahead of UX and saying, like, hey, this is kind of what I think I want this to look like before spinning UX cycles on, I'm making a more high-fi mock-up. Just that if you think it does a better job of describing it, then the issue itself, then use it. I think, I think in some cases, like a picture can be worth a thousand words. I mean, I'm not sure how many words you throw at something. It's like, you know, for example, one of my things that I request or I, I reported on for the release, uh, the kickoff meeting was, uh, expanding the epic view in the roadmap. And like, those are basically just a bunch of buzzwords put together that you're like, okay, what does that mean? Expand epic. And I'm just, I literally thought on that one, like 20 minutes saying, how do I make this epic? How do I make this issue titled, like, more descriptive for customer value? And it just came down to like, that is the functionality we're adding. What does that mean? Oh, here's the screenshot. You can see that we're going to add a drop down. You can see the issues and children have the things that are attached to that epic. And in that case, like, I was like, I'm so thankful I have a screenshot. Even though that one is actually not a high-fi, mock-up, it's more as more low-fi, it was a little bit pieced together. So, um, yeah, I think like in general, there's a lot more value if we can show something like that. So, you know, product manager, you can, you can consider that. You should feel free that you, you know, you're empowered to take a tool that you're comfortable with, even it might even be just like Google slides and make something that gets you at least part of the way there in terms of what you want the experience to look like. Yep, perfect. Uh, three C. I thought the talk track shifted. Uh, I was definitely more a problem focused. I noticed a number of speakers really trying to zero in on that, which is perfect. Some of them could have been more problem focused. I thought so I just keep, keep considering that as you, as you, yeah, it's important to be able to pitch these things in ways that people that aren't close to it can understand. And so just think about that. How do I explain this as someone who's cold, who doesn't know a darn thing about this, why should they care? That getting that crystal in your, in your thinking is going to be important no matter what. So, it's time will spend. Thanks, Scott. This is Green. I just said add to that. If you don't mind, um, I think this has always been a challenge in product, even before I've joined GetLab for many people's how to, how to get there on some of this terminology. Um, when those of us have deep technical background. Um, so my thought would be, is there a way that you can start sharing, uh, you know, or applauding good examples of this so that the product team can start to kind of reminate on this and and develop that scale if, if we're not there yet. Yeah. Uh, I thought Lucas were very well framed up. Those, those two popped out at me as yeah, that's the problem we're trying to solve. Check those out. I'll, I'll look through for some other examples. Thank you for the suggestion. All right, uh, 3D we went long. Um, we just have a ton of speakers, which I love that ever, that lots of people get a chance to speak. So, I'm, I'm good with that, but we're going to have to, we're going to have to limit the number of items, probably. Uh, so it looks like there's some other ideas in here. Perhaps themes. Yeah, I mean, if there are some that relate to each other, you could just tell a story. Hey, we're trying to prove this and then A, B, and C tied back to it. I think it's okay to be pretty brief in your description as long as you're hitting what it is and if somebody's really interested, they can dive deep. The, thematic is a good idea. Recorded video if you really want to go maybe it's technically complex. That's a great idea and then you can just cover the customer value at a high level, only the detail to the video. Uh, watch statistics. I think Josh looked this up last time. I think he said there were a thousand, oh, there we go. Kenny's putting it in. So somewhere between 500 and 1000. To kind of add to the time, just a feedback. I was timing myself this time and I had two features or two listed and I hit three minutes in 14 seconds. Obviously, I can shorten that. So when we talk about, you know, I think somebody mentioned doing two or coupling it down. It's interesting that I landed there with the, the two that I chose. Yep. That feels about average, but we've had how many speakers will probably have to be a couple minutes max for person. I mean, Eric pointed this out in the next line. I do think we are due for a rethink of how we're doing the kickoff because we're going to have next month. We're going to have 25 people trying to give content and even at two minutes already gone. So yeah, we expanded it. I will give a shout out for Jason, I know, because he's on paternity leave created a video, but I think the original intent of the kickoff was actually just as a company we had a retrospective and a kickoff. A retrospective immediately followed by a kickoff and we just decided to post that on YouTube. I mean, I post a whole bunch of content on YouTube. So just just having what you would normally do for your kind of like grooming or kickoff within your individual group posted to YouTube and us maybe having a specific channel for people who wanted to follow it. I mean, we should discuss it in an issue and come up with something I do think prior to next release kickoff. Just to evaluate alternatives to the format. Yeah, I mean, I don't even if we said every person has one minute. I feel like we're doing a disservice because we're now highlighting much less because we feel like we have a time constraint and need to keep it into one synchronous 30 minute block. I need to do that. Okay. Yeah, plus one, the revamping that I think I think we're trying to it's like, it's got so many jobs right now that we're not doing a good job at any of the ones of them. I think that feels the most important customers are internal and it's just like benefiting internally about because like the people tend that thing that we had like 50 people on a Zoom call alone not even considering YouTube and people were asking about what happened to YouTube link and things like that. So it's well attended internally. I think there's sort of alignment. So I'm going to run along the marketing value of like sort of like a release for a fictional customer that kind of feels like we better off have them make up webinar or live stream on the release date. Right. Yeah, maybe the externally focused one would be more about what we just should. There was a webinar that used to happen, I called release right up. I think I participated in a couple of those three of them back to back and they were pretty poorly attended from what my experience was and I think they actually got ended by the product marketing team for that reason. I'm sure someone from that team could actually give feedback. But I think one thing about the time limit is it's really hard to motivate problems particularly like in a short amount of time, particularly when they're very technical has product categories grow in maturity and sophistication. Like the problems become more and more specific that we're solving. And so motivating those specific reasons and why we're going up to like this specific tiny piece of the very mature category, it's hard to do at 30 seconds in a way that it's so if we want to do that better that's going to put more and more pressure on like communicating every reasonable number of items. I think. Okay. Thank you all for the feedback. I like the idea of creating an issue and perhaps tweaking the format the four next month. I also like the idea of asking internal and external constituents with a like or don't like about the format. Yeah, just one final thought on that like I love that it's a half an hour. I almost even like take picked particular categories over over a link thing the time as an example just because I feel the feeling that if you want to watch it consistently it's going to be in that block. But that's just me. So I like if other customers or you know saying send it with like the larger block then that's the right way to go. So that's that's where I love to get feedback and some fashion to get say okay you know here's how we should but we clearly have gone breath wise. We've gone so much broader that it's going to be hard to cover all the topics in that quick and down. Okay. Thanks Kenny for starting the issue. James, over to you for number four. Yeah, I just thought I'd share this. But many I think many on this haven't heard Mark Ponspatch speak about product discovery spritz but he advocated for this quite a number of times previously from his experience reckoning these that a prior company. So the idea is kind of different to a I guess a UX discovery sprint I think phobia and linked one of the books about that where it's really focused on UX iteration and research. The product discovery sprint is more focused on kind of like actually building something iterating on something that's built and trying to get to some sort of MVC really quickly by trying to make the process more synchronous. So the source code group is going to try and do that around file by file deft navigation to solve performance and usability problems in 12.3 and I thought it would be interesting to share that because internally we've been wrestling with like how to make this work well in an async slash remote environment. So we're looking at trying to confine the participants in a specific time zone so that we can all be available with a significant amount of overlap. But that's also difficult because we have it kind of excludes automatically 50% of the team who are just geographically remote from any of their peers. We only have one UX designer that's only available in the European time zone. So some interesting challenges there. If it goes well we're going to try and replicate it. I release it to later on a different problem that is also really complicated hard and we want to make progress on quickly. But I'll share any findings we have. And if anyone's interested in discussing that with me more and put a meeting in my calendar or drop me a set message. This is great, James. By the way, I think the UX team is going to run well, let me just say we have the option to run one with Google Ventures, who's one of our investors in that sprint book that Fabianne Link 2 was written by a guy from GV. They did hundreds of these things for our clients. They know what they're doing. So if we get a chance to do one with them we should. We're going to have to figure out how to do it within our async model though. So whatever you learn from yours, James, please feed that back. Super interesting topic. I think if we could get good at this asynchronously, that would be a breakthrough. Yeah, I think one other interesting challenge is that the sprint sort of terminology is kind of challenging and it's not sustainable to be doing design sprints or discovery sprints on a daily basis. Whether or not we were in person or not, it's not scalable to actually sprint all the time. So choosing the right task, choosing the right time is one of the other challenges. I agree. Yeah, you don't want to do this for everything because, well, if you follow to the letter, it takes a whole week and you're totally dedicated to it, which is amazing for focus, sick, but you can't get anything else done. So depending on how we structure this, it would need to be done for things that are really big unknowns, where dedicating a huge chunk of time like that is worth it and not everything clears that bar. I think it's also most relevant for for stages that are very, very interesting in the very beginning. Kind of like, that Tyron was like one of their biggest examples for Google ventures when they always say like solving clinical trials for the world is like a super complex problem. So they just figure out what is this thing that we can do so that we can start getting there and I think these are different problems that that is very, this is pretty useful. We used it pretty successfully at my last company around pricing and packaging stuff and ran a bunch of interviews with customers on that. So I've seen it work. All right. Okay, Christopher, number five. Yeah, just want to call out, we've over the past month we've had a significant number of outages related to dot com and that affect at least a one customer revenue with actual and because of that, we've had some focus from an executive leadership perspective. So I encourage everybody to look at that document and kind of look through it and particularly there's a couple of things from an engineering perspective, make you aware of one is as we started it in for structure to development board where we're going to start matching issues up and trying to make sure that those get prioritized highly where appropriate particularly for anything that effects performance around these issues. The other issue that I put in there was one around that's listed specifically which is around the fact of prioritizing P performance availability work. So one of the significant features of this up to go recent outage last week was is that the redist server apparently can't handle the load anymore. We started digging into it. We found a bunch of stuff that we had and checked to like for instance. It's an example of RJ unit test where basically going and getting cached and there was no limit on the number of unit tests that could actually be cached. So we were getting these blocks of like several megabytes of data that had the basically be transferred around and read us and that's really what's affecting its performance overall from a caching service perspective. So consequently it's got to be a sin that to you. I hope that's okay. It feels like you need to help out when it hurts the effect of how do we best make sure that we get this kind of systematically going and I just want to make sure that everybody was wearing just kind of a kind of for discussion if there were any questions or any feedback or really feedback on it from that perspective. I added some comments to it Christopher. Okay I haven't had a chance to look at all those about that. Can I ask do we and maybe make this a question for you? Do we categorize performance issues as bugs? We do have a performance label but they should be under under bugs. Okay. Yeah, this is an example where oftentimes the way we treat performances is a reactionary. This is trying to think about it more in a proactive way. So like as an example, I'll give a horrible example but when I worked at Amazon tags originally when Amazon was created tags where they were expecting them just a label, you know, certain instances and that was it. It turns out that all customer started using like 20 and 30 or 50 tags and they're like what that's going on and they realized tags were being used to basically share environmental information so the VMs could they could put the same drop of code on two different VMs and they could behave differently based on the tag which was a total novel way for customers to use it. So then they had the basic limit that number of tags that they could use because it wasn't scaling with the system effectively. So like this is kind of another example where like I think we got to start thinking in terms of you know like when we create something new or new feature of piece of functionality like what's the cost associated with that right because like it does cost something internal and I'm not asking product managers to necessarily think in terms of the exact bytes but I am concerned to think in terms of like you know what are the expectations around because like as an example if we went back and looked at G unit test or reporting you know if we said unlimited that's you know that's a tough engineering call right particularly guess it's free right now for customer status is a minor shaming. We also don't have a number of reposemirers. We don't have a limit on that and that that seems dangerous. Yeah so I guess I would comment you know I think the product team is expected to prioritize all things and to understand them deeply whether they're a security issue or performance concern I think what you're highlighting is in order to be proactive I don't know if the product team would immediately know the impact of a proposed change but maybe that's not a two-nate for our infrastructure SRE stable counterparts to be involved in vetting and looking at issues early in the pipeline to decide whether or not they would. Yeah or or let's say we're implementing a feature like let's say we were implementing mirror from scratch like the first question we should be asking is like how many mirrors does a customer expected to be able to support and what I want to start charging for if they get above the SRE limit and you know and right now we don't and you could argue that scaling is just as much a reason for customers to start paying us as as features that's that's kind of the argument I would be making because those things cost money like whether we like to admit it or not. Yeah Chris I would agree with you on what you're trying to sort of shape up and call out here in the sense of you know going through pages for example performance of of getting those pageal is loaded is not great and I don't know if we set out originally to track some of those performance things but I think that performance and into your point can I think performance should be somewhere incorporated as we move forward into something we should be thinking about for scalability across the board because it's just as important as bringing forth that really cool thing to them is that that really cool thing works and people will stay there to use it. I think just as a cycle I think we have something the product tempo that I read a couple days ago on performance something like fast applications are always you know like more usable and I think that's that's definitely important and I also think that Githlet.com is massive I think we have 4 million users and for example for GEO I know that only by actually interacting with the infrastructure we are getting feedback on some of the performance bottlenecks that we are just not seeing otherwise and so I think that's actually also really valuable and in that regard maybe also again you know dog fooding these things helps and I think with the combination of CD we may hit a lot of those things at the moment. Yeah and the dog fooding thing on that front is a little confusing me I met with Maren to talk about that and you know there's this mentality of looking at.com first or leading with.com for scalability and I just it's not really crisp to me where we're going from making sure that we're you know how we approach me ensure that we in tech scalability for.com if we're starting the.com or restarting somewhere else from a dog fooding perspective. I'm pretty sure the handbook says that we're meant to well at least the guidelines used to be that for new features that we meant to be available on getlab.com and cell posts would at the same time and that there used to be a production where pretty checklist that I think the engineering team was responsible for. I know that for any launch and GEO there was a production readiness process that we had to go through and certainly we could easily we consider these things on the source code front we're readily considering scale like moving terabytes of data from the database and the object storage and considering all these sorts of things performance is very much a feature and should be considered that and I think particularly in categories where adoption is still growing and in early stages of maturity performance like understandably is less of a concern because there's low usage so like solving scale at like any normal. It doesn't make sense commercially like necessarily when usage is small so there is a bit of a juggling act here because we don't want to build a product for billions of users if there's only I don't know 20,000 users experimenting with our newest feature so there's an iterative approach and you'll need to be taken but I would agree that particularly coming from a team that's digging out a lot of technical debt and solving a lot of performance problems all the time we've probably historically not been very good at picking the right moment to pay off technical debt and address performance problems until they become fires. Yeah so to to that point just real quick James and sorry Scott I think some things are obvious like when we look at our progressive deliveries strategy I think that we like if you look at something like feature flags or something like that like that's something that I think is going to be like I wouldn't imagine that that's not going to be a key feature that we're going to bring forward so I feel like that should be a give me on whether adoption has yet struck or not but the second thing that is not clear to me like again when I was interviewing Maryn about dog fooding is that I noticed that Maryn's like we don't this isn't we weren't they didn't come to us first and so this is not scalable or this is not usable for us internally and so it's like the approach and process moving forward to dog food in the right spots is not clear to me or you know what the best practice has been or if anybody's you know crack that yeah I can give a concrete example please I did a call with Maryn a few months back around confidential murder quests so we knew that customers wanted to resolve them we knew that we wanted to do that and we're trying to get rid of dev.gilland.org so I had a video call with him and a bunch of acing conversations with like I've got these ideas for the first iteration looks like and then we did a few calls and worked through them and worked out which were the things that needed to happen and so we're shipping the first iteration of that and 12.1 so we coordinated with them and spoke I spoke with Maryn quite a lot to make sure whatever we were building was useful and would solve the security problems that they had as well as our own ones so yeah I agree it needs to be proactive when I'm going to ship something's useful or that the infrastructure team is going to want to opt into unless we've had a conversation with them in advance. All right it's 30 seconds and I had one life last time. It's sometimes really important for customers as well that we're running it on GitLab.com before they adopt it so one example is we built SSL TLS support in Gitaly but it's not turned on in GitLab.com and so the customer that we built it for isn't using it because they're waiting for our production team to turn it on because they want to see before they turn it on for their enormous instance have we actually proven it at the world's largest GitLab instance scale so I think that's one important reason why we always need to make sure that features are on and I'm getting used on GitLab.com. Just kidding again I rip sorry I got a couple of things I think we definitely have a stronger definition than I've done as part of our progressives delivery right and so part of something that's done is it needs to run at scale and get that.com successfully and not below the cost model not below performance and if it does it's just going to be rewarded frankly and that should be the bar for our Genefeatures across the line but doesn't mean for new features you know that have low usage that you know I was there in fact really quite small but these still it needs to be within reason I totally agree that you don't want to overfill on the first iteration for planning for millions of users that have that's just making a sense but yeah I think that's one aspect I think their aspect is that I'm your kind of person on pricing and we can maybe have a fallout here on like a handbook update but I think it's interesting that customer is well absorbed the cost on self-managed of compute and so for them if they want to have a ridiculous number of you know mirrorless then you know and then it's fine because they're paying for it so use cases on their dime and so maybe a way of thinking about this to have some level of controls you can set if you want to your things and sub the list sort of I don't have have some way to control that and a matter of behavior for when we're covering the cost of those things but yeah anyways. Thank you all great topic Christopher please pile on that issue with thoughts on how to handle this like you're suggesting on definition of done Josh. All right Karina, six and seven. Yes so I submitted an MR for the product Humbuk yesterday and we're going through this process of getting more self-organized in the release area and with our engineering and and user design partners and you know one of the things that we recognize and it's documented in the issue below in number seven is you know one our delivery percentage is not been great what you've heard me talk about but we've been able to print that we need to self-organize around some method and what we found and sort of the last prioritization for a release scope is that we have a lot of oversized issues and features that you know honestly need a need a beat for release to go through user research maybe look at the code if they've never seen the code you know reviewed that piece of code before or makes the recommendations on the best way to solve so I put some thinking around you know that sort of you know that dual track mindset dual track agile kind of launching off of what user experiences recently updated for dual track agile so feedback on that and then the second piece is that this experiment running is relievings semi dual track agile approach just to organize our conversation how we open issues for areas that we need a discovery beat versus presenting an issue that is actually ready for delivery one thing that was interesting Scott and we were talking about you know just the kickoff call and having some you know images and more to share that's definitely where I think we'd like to be with release is getting ahead of that curve and really having some concrete understanding and prototypes of what we're trying to to present deliver but when we looked at sort of kind of going through that process you know this is really for complex things or heavy lifting because you know it is about a 20 to 30 day lead time to come in so we have some targets to improve you know our hypothesis on leveraging this you get follow it there if you haven't put but it kind of tied together but I love it put on the handbook piece. Thank you Karina for creating these and sharing these I think you're on the right track in parallel I've been working with like Christopher and Eric and Christie to outline a high level description of our software development lifecycle which will have two tracks this is sort of competing content there or maybe maybe they could be merged so thank you for doing this I may slow roll it a little bit to make sure that we have one way of describing the flow we'd like to go through but thank you very much for getting a kicked off any questions for Karina? Not Joshua do you? Yeah just a few risk announcement you're showing through a ring the promise label to playing priority general meaning is large in the same although it should be promising features and so this is just a way to flag it and that way it's where minor for PM is that this issue had some importance left we make sure all the dependencies and so just be aware of it so you can feel for to use it I did note in the label text that it should only be applied by product managers and in particular the responsible pod manager for that section so it shouldn't be applied by cam or anyone else Awesome I like that terminology a lot better thank you Josh All right five minutes of spare anything else If not have a great Tuesday at a yes", "summary": "**Part 1 Summary:**\n Okay, if it's like my family, I definitely have no subjects. So if you just searched for that near your email, you should be able to find it. We got a good rhythm going on hiring. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 2 Summary:**\nHe originally came through the growth funnel. Okay. Okay. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 3 Summary:**\nI think the point is, when you're thinking of customers for your thing, think of our internal teams early. Many of the issues we're saying we're going to do UX front end and back end in the same iteration. And in that case, like, I was like, I'm so thankful I have a screenshot. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 4 Summary:**\nSo, um, yeah, I think like in general, there's a lot more value if we can show something like that. Uh, so it looks like there's some other ideas in here. A retrospective immediately followed by a kickoff and we just decided to post that on YouTube. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 5 Summary:**\nSo just just having what you would normally do for your kind of like grooming or kickoff within your individual group posted to YouTube and us maybe having a specific channel for people who wanted to follow it. And so motivating those specific reasons and why we're going up to like this specific tiny piece of the very mature category, it's hard to do at 30 seconds in a way that it's so if we want to do that better that's going to put more and more pressure on like communicating every reasonable number of items. But many I think many on this haven't heard Mark Ponspatch speak about product discovery spritz but he advocated for this quite a number of times previously from his experience reckoning these that a prior company. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 6 Summary:**\nThe product discovery sprint is more focused on kind of like actually building something iterating on something that's built and trying to get to some sort of MVC really quickly by trying to make the process more synchronous. Super interesting topic. Okay, Christopher, number five. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 7 Summary:**\nSo I encourage everybody to look at that document and kind of look through it and particularly there's a couple of things from an engineering perspective, make you aware of one is as we started it in for structure to development board where we're going to start matching issues up and trying to make sure that those get prioritized highly where appropriate particularly for anything that effects performance around these issues. Okay I haven't had a chance to look at all those about that. We also don't have a number of reposemirers. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 8 Summary:**\nYeah so I guess I would comment you know I think the product team is expected to prioritize all things and to understand them deeply whether they're a security issue or performance concern I think what you're highlighting is in order to be proactive I don't know if the product team would immediately know the impact of a proposed change but maybe that's not a two-nate for our infrastructure SRE stable counterparts to be involved in vetting and looking at issues early in the pipeline to decide whether or not they would. Yeah and the dog fooding thing on that front is a little confusing me I met with Maren to talk about that and you know there's this mentality of looking at.com first or leading with.com for scalability and I just it's not really crisp to me where we're going from making sure that we're you know how we approach me ensure that we in tech scalability for.com if we're starting the.com or restarting somewhere else from a dog fooding perspective. I'm pretty sure the handbook says that we're meant to well at least the guidelines used to be that for new features that we meant to be available on getlab.com and cell posts would at the same time and that there used to be a production where pretty checklist that I think the engineering team was responsible for. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 9 Summary:**\nIt doesn't make sense commercially like necessarily when usage is small so there is a bit of a juggling act here because we don't want to build a product for billions of users if there's only I don't know 20,000 users experimenting with our newest feature so there's an iterative approach and you'll need to be taken but I would agree that particularly coming from a team that's digging out a lot of technical debt and solving a lot of performance problems all the time we've probably historically not been very good at picking the right moment to pay off technical debt and address performance problems until they become fires. Yeah so to to that point just real quick James and sorry Scott I think some things are obvious like when we look at our progressive deliveries strategy I think that we like if you look at something like feature flags or something like that like that's something that I think is going to be like I wouldn't imagine that that's not going to be a key feature that we're going to bring forward so I feel like that should be a give me on whether adoption has yet struck or not but the second thing that is not clear to me like again when I was interviewing Maryn about dog fooding is that I noticed that Maryn's like we don't this isn't we weren't they didn't come to us first and so this is not scalable or this is not usable for us internally and so it's like the approach and process moving forward to dog food in the right spots is not clear to me or you know what the best practice has been or if anybody's you know crack that yeah I can give a concrete example please I did a call with Maryn a few months back around confidential murder quests so we knew that customers wanted to resolve them we knew that we wanted to do that and we're trying to get rid of dev.gilland.org so I had a video call with him and a bunch of acing conversations with like I've got these ideas for the first iteration looks like and then we did a few calls and worked through them and worked out which were the things that needed to happen and so we're shipping the first iteration of that and 12.1 so we coordinated with them and spoke I spoke with Maryn quite a lot to make sure whatever we were building was useful and would solve the security problems that they had as well as our own ones so yeah I agree it needs to be proactive when I'm going to ship something's useful or that the infrastructure team is going to want to opt into unless we've had a conversation with them in advance. All right it's 30 seconds and I had one life last time. It's sometimes really important for customers as well that we're running it on GitLab.com before they adopt it so one example is we built SSL TLS support in Gitaly but it's not turned on in GitLab.com and so the customer that we built it for isn't using it because they're waiting for our production team to turn it on because they want to see before they turn it on for their enormous instance have we actually proven it at the world's largest GitLab instance scale so I think that's one important reason why we always need to make sure that features are on and I'm getting used on GitLab.com. \n\n**Part 10 Summary:**\nJust kidding again I rip sorry I got a couple of things I think we definitely have a stronger definition than I've done as part of our progressives delivery right and so part of something that's done is it needs to run at scale and get that.com successfully and not below the cost model not below performance and if it does it's just going to be rewarded frankly and that should be the bar for our Genefeatures across the line but doesn't mean for new features you know that have low usage that you know I was there in fact really quite small but these still it needs to be within reason I totally agree that you don't want to overfill on the first iteration for planning for millions of users that have that's just making a sense but yeah I think that's one aspect I think their aspect is that I'm your kind of person on pricing and we can maybe have a fallout here on like a handbook update but I think it's interesting that customer is well absorbed the cost on self-managed of compute and so for them if they want to have a ridiculous number of you know mirrorless then you know and then it's fine because they're paying for it so use cases on their dime and so maybe a way of thinking about this to have some level of controls you can set if you want to your things and sub the list sort of I don't have have some way to control that and a matter of behavior for when we're covering the cost of those things but yeah anyways.

"}, {"name": "2024-10-01_Council_Meeting1.mp3", "transcript": " Thank you. This is the arm of Springfield meeting agenda for October 1st, 2024. That exactly six PM. Call this a meeting into order and then I'd like to get Councillor Miller for Invocation. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And by those who wish to join me in a word of prayer. Father, God, we thank you for today. We thank you for that. We ask that you give us insight and guidance in our deliberations tonight. Lord, we want to extend the invitation to peace for Israel. We know that there are being bombarded today. And it's turmoil for many people. But Lord, we lift up those who are seeking peace. We know that you're the author of peace. And so we look to you for that guidance as the world is in turmoil. And we pray all these things in the name of your name in your name, Lord. Amen. Thank you. Land acknowledgement, Melinda. The arm of Springfield acknowledges that we are gathered on ancestral lands. Treaty one territory, traditional territory of the Anashnabi. Create OGC, Dakota and Denay peoples. And on the national homeland of the Red River, Mati. Thank you. Then we'll go to item four and that's approval of the agenda. Gonna get a mover and a seconder for that. Patrick and Maglan. Be resolved that the agenda be approved. In the editions from Council or Notes from Council. I see none. Then at this point we are prepared to vote on approval of agenda. That is unanimous and is carried. Let's go to adoption of the minutes. Please, gonna get a mover or a seconder for that as well. A Melinda Anglan. Res minutes of the Council meeting held September 17th have been previously distributed. Council be resolved that the same be in our hereby approved. Any comments from Council at all? I get a show hands those in support of the Council minutes. September 17th. As unanimous and is carried. Then we'll get to reports there and mover and a seconder for item six. That's a reports, please. That's Mark and Melinda. Be resolved that Council activity reports for the month of September be received as information. Any questions comments? Mark. Thank you Mr. Barrett. I just wanted to make note that today is national seniors day and I just want to extend an appreciation to Diane Duma's who. Is very active in our community for all the seniors and doesn't extraordinary job. And of course to. Can place and all those who are involved do go place all those who are involved with seniors. I think this is making our community a vibrant. Post but a very. Rewarding place to be and as you know, this council is very committed to embracing and supporting seniors. Activities as well as we're trying to work towards of course having more seniors. Lodging as well. I just have one question though and it is on that council refuel's report. I know that he was able to attend the arm meeting last month and I'm just wondering I was unfortunately not able to attend it and I know we do get quite a bit of useful information out of that. Resuegey three municipalities that report or provide updates. Was there anything that stuck out for you that might be advantageous for us to know. I'm just a little bit more. I'm just a little bit more. I'm just a little bit more. I'm just a little bit of opinions. Nothing too big on that end of it. Basically everybody just again gathering. We did a conversation around guest speakers. We talked about what we would like to seek in the fall and in the winter coming for for us to put our suggestions forward. So again yes that's a good point. Anyway, that didn't attend to please but if you have anything. Let them know and they'll try to get them in a speakers for the winter and that was basically the just of it. Thank you. Any other questions or any. Yes Mr Mayor, I want to ask you about John Q meeting. You said you was discussed with and presentation to architect and builders to John Q and you suggesting that. You advise them that we have 39 acres and land available to acres. Did you discuss that with the council that we're going to have two acres provided to daycare center. No I. I've discussed it openly with council and in chambers there that would be an ideal place. To have a daycare and the main consensus there for John Q is it's an accessible initiative for having the daycare there. We do need a daycare in this in the RM it would be a such it could be situated there I never said that we are committed. This was just something with regards to land being available. They need two acres actually I think I may misspelled that it should be 2.2 acres. And once we get a water up and running past there then we're able to to do that should that be the decision of the council. Secondly W. Maran board meeting no with Mr. Bushy what that means no with Mr. Bushy Mr. Bushy was there was no Mr. Bushy. Missed all. That's a misspelled on my part. I guess you have that's what I have to say and the questions from council. I think I have a show hands and support reports. That is unanimous and is carried. When we get to departmental reports 6.2 can I get a mover in a second or for that please. Patrick and Melinda. It was all that September department operating reports be accepted as information. Any questions from council with regards to our reports here. Thank you Mr. Mayor under the public works I just want to give a word of confidence or. I appreciate the effort that was put into these I know there is a lot of work done in these reports and for this one specifically I was able to go on a lot of information. And particularly because not only the point form that was there but the pictures that were there too because a lot of these projects are under construction or ongoing and you know we don't have I think. The opportunity to visit all these sites so I really appreciate the. Public works to put that in but my other question would be for Springfield fire and rescue in their report. I. Is that okay. Well, I was just trying to remember I got something here. Yeah, I'm the old go ahead. Okay. The under emergency motor vehicle collisions for September. It's reported that there is 80 and I'm just shocked at that number. I I'm not questioning their number. It's just. What kind of incidents it's not ice season. It's not in climate weather. It's I mean, you know, these fender vendors that. Like, where are the happening? We're not a city as such. I can imagine open can we not many closions do hold or an older, but. Is there any detail on are these just. Yeah, that's so clear today. Yes, I thought it was. Oh, I see. Today, okay, then the other question I would have is there's. Vehicle fires are 16 to date. So the only reason I asked that is that related to electric vehicles. I mean, no, none of them. Or just fires in. Got them. Okay, great. Thank you. And yes, I would like to. Say it that we went to appreciation. Day for our employees and the public works and was really impressive to see that equipment that we. And we're just. Or or leasing for for our community to service and, you know, great the roads and may probably clean the snow. And looks really nice that, you know, we have that good equipment now and our employees can do proper job and this thing. And probably maybe we say big money to on that. Thank you. Thank you, Andy. So, I think that's a good job for all the good job to Lisa from our health and safety there. I don't think she gets enough recognition of been to a few of the health and safety. I mean, she's just not able to make as many as I'd like to. But her reports are quite detailed there and we need that. It required by a lot of have it, but still she doesn't exceptional job for the health and safety and that's quite important for. For everybody in our employees. Maybe we should have Lisa's name on the bottom of that report too, is that possible. That's her report if she's able to design it or sign off on it there. I think that you a little bit of recognition for a job well done. I was going to ask asset management there, but it's not something I have to get an answer to or counsel. The tri asset to three value asset projections there. How far are we with regards to that? And I don't think no more has to respond to that, unless he's online, but if he's not, that I could wait for a reply later on, but that's all I had. Any other questions from counsel? Then at this point here, if I can show what we get a show hands of regards to departmental reports. This is carried as unanimous. Then we'll go to item seven, that's question period. We've got 15 minutes for that and only questions pertain to the current agenda items. We have two people in the audience here, but I'll go from the audience to the screen here. Anybody in the audience for a question at all? Then online. Nobody. Okay, there's no questions, then I don't see many reasons to hold off on it or have it any, many of the discussion with regards to that. And if we can proceed to consent agenda, that's item number 11. Finally, I knew that. Okay, sir. Yep, go ahead, Owen. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to revisit and let me see here. Subtemporary 1824 of your report in regards to the John Q meeting. And you indicate that there's of 39 acres land available where 2.0 acres will be made available with a proof of count. The proof of count for a day care. Now, I do appreciate that John Q has an illustrious agenda. 1.2 billion dollars for a lot of law for John Q across Canada for day care centers. I understand that agenda. However, that agenda includes for not only just day care centers, but purchase of lands. Given that you have taken land speculation, 38,000 plus per acre for this acquisition of lands that are two acres possibly available. I would suggest that John Q would buy council approval, a cert at around $350,000 for those lands plus. They then would build a center for children. And I don't think that's unreasonable. In fact, I think that John Q by its $1.2 billion dollars, sirson, has already ascended that they are willing to pay for land. And although we have different subrepidients as to what was paid for the land, I do believe that it is only reasonable that council would avail these lands for around $350,000. And that John Q build a brand new child center. And we would be very appreciative to the federal government on all accounts. I just like to make that note for you and for your consideration, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Edwin. Let's see any other, oh, Janet. Go ahead. There, can you hear me now? Yeah. Thank you. So I'm sorry. I lost my picture on the screen because I thought that question period was was not on the agenda. So I was asking that question to. I have two questions. One item 10 unfinished business. It said no. And I guess I'm kind of wondering what the status is of the procedure by law in 2410. And when it's coming back, like is that not unfinished business? Like I'd like it to be recorded. And then you can tell us sometime when it's coming back on the next agenda or the time frame please. Also, and Mrs. Vag's head, I made an appearance before council and asked, I think it was deferred for reports from departments. I just think that two should be considered as unfinished business. And I would, I would like when those reports are available, but it, it come back on the agenda. My last question is on 12.1. I guess those questions. I maybe you don't think that there, let's go back for a minute. Maybe you don't think that those are unfinished business items that should be recorded. Would you comment on that please? As for Mrs. Vag's will deal directly with Mrs. Vag's. And I believe we're still doing that. That's question two. So question one unfinished business. The status of the procedural bylaw there. I'll defer it to her CEO for that. And the question three. Sorry to write down there. I haven't, I haven't asked questions three yet. I guess my point is that the purpose of unfinished business is to keep track of those kind of items. And in people that are interested in council's decision. And we understand you have to have consultation with staff and whatever and then bring it back. But usually people would itemize them as unfinished business and maybe put beside it, you know, pending reports or give us a timeline. So I'm, I guess I'm asking you to consider doing that. So we don't lose sight of some of the things that are before you. My last question is on 12.1. And I think it's the settler's road bridge crossing CCB 13. Yep. So I guess as I understand it, there's an additional 33,300 dollars of work to be done in 2024 by the Northeastern. Mr., street\u4f60\u662f are going to settle is most benefiting from economy. And is he responsible? Maybe he will also benefit. Um, the amount of yes, but I'm not sure when building was going to go forward, cost and additional 66,600. And they're requesting council to approve 50% of that cost in the 2025 budget. They're just looking for kind of the approval now before they make any final decisions on this additional funding. So yes, it would be built in 2025, but we're just looking for council's approval to include that in the 2025 capital budget. OK, so the work is not being done this year. I don't know if some is being done, but we know it's going to be additional cost. And because we did not have that factored in 2024, we're asking council to include that in 2025, it'll be probably a two-year project if not more. So I guess my point is to caution council that if the work is done in 2024, it's an expense to you in 2024 under accounting principles. And if you remember back, I think it was something that the auditor pointed out, and we had to pay $800,000, or something for something that wasn't recorded in the proper. It was a deficit that we had to take out of reserves, or something to pay back, something that wasn't done in the time frame. So if the work is being done in 2024, it is a debt to the municipality. And I think you have to kind of look within your budget to find those funds to cover it. If the work is being done next year, that's something else that I wasn't clear about. Thank you. Yeah, I'm sure our director of public works can confirm that when he speaks about the project, but I don't believe that project has started yet, so it will be continuing in 2025. OK, thank you. Thank you. Any other questions? I see none. Then at this point here, prepare to close the question period, and then we'll go to consent agenda. On the consent agenda is 11.1. That's the same Ratt River watershed district minutes. 11.2 is age-friendly newsletter. 11.3 is community futures. Winnipeg River. And lastly is AMM News bulletin. We received all those. Any questions with regards that from Council? I see none. Then if we can do it as a consent agenda. Oh, I need a mover and a second for that, please. I'm Linda and Andy. Whereas a consent agenda has been submitted, consisting of four items. We resolved that the said consent agenda will be received as information. No questions from Council, as soon. Then at this point here, I'm prepared to have a vote who's in support of me as unanimous and as carried. Then we'll get to set those road bridge crossing project. That's 12.1. Can I get a mover and a second for that, please? Melinda and Patrick. Mr. Mayor. Okay. Be it resolved that the Council of the Armistran Field approves the additional cost of 33,300, including applicable taxes for the settlers' road bridge crossing project to be included in the 2025 Capitol budget. Thank you. Any questions? Would you have any questions? I'll just go ahead. Andy? Yes, Mr. Mayor. Somebody talking to me. Please. My indulgent? No, we're just going ahead. Yes, and why those costs increased? Do they do explanation or? I think plain is online, but just quickly in the report, it says the additional funds are due to unforeseen costs and additional decommissioning requirements for the existing infrastructure. So those are the extra costs that the district informed us about. So plain might have more information. I know he's online for this item. So. Yep, no, I'm here. That's exactly what I didn't report. Then we went from the district to the additional cost. And earlier to Janet's question, so the project has not started this year. So they'll be continued in 2025 to finalize. And did we verify that information from there? We went there and checked out the bridge. And why the costs are increasing? Other costs are increasing due to additional decommissioning of the existing bridge. There's additional all-incosp and material cost have gone up to the original, I estimate of this project. So that'll be carried over next year again. Or to start later this year, be carried over the next year. We're anticipating those additional increases as well. And then we start this project. Well, last I talked to the district. We're looking at starting probably later this month's some point. Also, just up and like because somebody make estimate that going across 160,000. So when that happened and then once they went and looked at the bridge and the whole project, then they determined that it's going to cost more because of the increase in the prices of the material. So in between material costing, I guess. And the additional hauling so if we can't haul to where we you know, for the dump site where they were going to maybe haul to, it may be further away now or there was more material. That was maybe underestimated that that has to be hauled out to part of the decommissioning. So those are why they increased costs. But did we like it? They sent us the estimate that somebody went from our public works and checked out the project. They were really the true numbers. Or how did that happen? That they just can come to us and say, well, it's going to cost more so we just pay. Yeah, no, we have a very good working relationship with the district always have been. So for me to question, I mean, and I did ask why the increase. And that's what the information they gave us back. So we're very well aware of the bridge and the condition. So I would have no reason to question why they're, the increases would be. Their board is also aware of these increases. And they were given the same detail as this council now. So. OK, thank you very much, Ben. Welcome. Thank you, Ben. Any questions? Any further questions? I got to show hands. Those are the support of the 12.1. As you know, I was. Then what could we talk for the point two? Not to say in a rat. It's a rosal watershed committee appointment. They're moving to seconder for 12.2. Mark and Glenn. Be resilient that the following people be appointed to the same rat rosal watershed district sub-district nine for the period ending on or about the third Tuesday of November 2025, Councillor Glenn Fuel and Claude Roland as citizen rap. Questions from council at all? I see none. I got to show hands those in support of 12.2. The watershed committee. As you know, for this carry 12.3. Why why do I keep on hearing him? Can I get 12.3? 12.3. Well yeah. Could we just unmute him or mute him? Oh I see. Let's go to 12.3. There that's the Northeast Red Watershed District Committee appointment. There can I get a move on a seconder please. I'm a Linda and Patrick. Be resolved that the following people be appointed to the Northeast Red Watershed District for the period ending on or about the third Tuesday of November 2025. Cars Creek Lower St. River, Councillor Andy Kaczynski, citizen members Roger Voggs and Frank Helen. Lower Cook's Creek, Councillor Glenn Fuel, citizen member Elwood Lamont. Upper Cook's Creek, Councillor Melinda Warren, citizen member, Renny Grift. Brokenhead River, citizen members, Brent Collette and one vacant position that needs to be filled. Devil's Creek Mayor Pat Terrian, citizen member, Darren Smith, Red River, Councillor Mark Miller, citizen member vacant. Are we supposed to figure out those vacancies? One for councilful or? I think if we can approve these, everyone I've set of citizen members has confirmed. They will stay on the committee. I know that Councillor Fuel has reached out to one citizen. See if they would be interested. So as soon as possible if council can bring names forward for those two vacancies, then we can get that set before there. I think it's mid-October. They are hoping to have the appointments made. I was going to ask somebody in my hockey team today, but you never showed up for today, but like October 15th, I believe, is our next meeting. We would need to have two names, still point at that time. So council will put our heads together, who might be good for those two vacancies. So it would be great. So then if there's any questions, can I get a show hands? Those are supported to 12.3. You know, I'm a citizen of this carried. Let's go to 12.4 please. That's the 2024 non-profit community grants. I'm over in the second report, please. Mark and Melinda. It resolved that the following non-profit organizations and community service groups receive a grant for 2024 in the amount of o-bank and district community club, 12,000 80463, Cook's Creek Community Club 11,51225, sunrise lodge, 326471, and Melinda district museum, 125058, and Melinda district over 50 club, 2344, 44, Springfield Agricultural Society, 7,40939, Springfield Tashay, Weed District, 73103, Cook's Creek Heritage Museum, 2840, Society of Ivan Franco 94124, and Hazelrod Sports Complex 690866. What those read in the questions from council, Mark? Just a quick question, Mr. Mayor. Just if you could remind me or somebody could remind me what this Society of Ivan Franco is again. So this used to be an active community club. It's located off, Lauren Hill Road, North of Garvin. So this is, it's at all building that's there. So we are in discussions of obtaining that land. It's just taking a bit longer than we had hoped. So right now council still considers a grant for that property. Yeah, the questions are just council. Did I see none? Can they get a show hands? Those in support of 12.4 on 2024, non-profit community of grants. Any? That's unanimous. Carried. We go to 12.5 and it's a water appropriations. There, move her in a second or please. Patrick and Melinda. So just before I read the resolution, we've had a few requests. So I'll just go through those with council. There's sidewalk repair on the RM rate of way at sunrise lodge estimated at $3,500. There's three park benches being considered around the crystal lake retention pond at the three public easement areas. And that's estimated at $5,000 with, yeah, I think that includes taxes and delivery. And then we received a request from Duval parent advisory council for their playground project as well. So council did give them money in 2023 and they've requested again this year. So. Okay, what would be the term as so far? I think I said I put a thousand towards the sidewalk. Was it there? So you had put a thousand towards the benches and you were willing to contribute to sidewalk. But you didn't give them out. Okay. Um, Councillor Warren contributed a thousand to the benches and a thousand to the sidewalk repair. I'll commit to 500 each. Anybody else at all? Andy? Yeah, I do 500 each, do. Mark, I'm going to hold off on this one, Mr. Mayor. Okay. Have we got enough to cover the expenses then with what we have from council? Was the 3500 bucks that sidewalk? Yeah. So we have 2500 towards the benches. So that's half of the 5,000. We have, sorry, you were putting a thousand to the sidewalk? Yeah. So we have 2500 towards the sidewalk. I'm going to need 35. Yeah. And we have 1000 to the dual parents advisory council. I didn't see that part. Yeah, I think I'm stretched pretty fin 1000 and 1000. There, until the rest is that, is that a good start? Yeah, we can update the spreadsheet and bring it back to council on the next meeting and okay. We have other projects. You can add those on. Okay. Yeah, the questions from council at all. I see none. Then we can go to show hands of those in support of water appropriations 12.5. As you know, I'm just in this carried. Then the last is the closing of the meeting and then subsequent adjournment going to get a mover and a seconder for closing of the meeting. Please mark in Melinda. Sorry, I don't have any items for closing meeting. Oh, okay. I don't know why the heck is that's that's just changed out to item 15 adjournment. Then any questions from council at all? And we were on a seconder for adjournment. Melinda and Patrick. Then at 635, October 1st, we'll close the meeting. Thank you very much. Sir Mayor, could you please?", "summary": " Thank you. September 17th. You advise them that we have 39 acres and land available to acres\n\nDid you discuss that with the council that we're going to have two acres provided to daycare center. It's just. I think that you a little bit of recognition for a job well done\n\nI was going to ask asset management there, but it's not something I have to get an answer to or counsel. Thank you, Edwin. I guess my point is that the purpose of unfinished business is to keep track of those kind of items\n\nAnd in people that are interested in council's decision. On the consent agenda is 11.1. Yes, and why those costs increased? Do they do explanation or? I think plain is online, but just quickly in the report, it says the additional funds are due to unforeseen costs and additional decommissioning requirements for the existing infrastructure\n\nSo those are the extra costs that the district informed us about.

This is the arm of Springfield meeting agenda December 10th, 2024. Committee of a whole and we're starting exactly one PM. This is the call to order. I'm elected to choose council and nobody in the audience today, but people are online. So welcome everybody. I am Mayor Patrick Terion for the arm of Springfield. And to my left is our CEO calling Draper. And in different is the assistant CEO, across the grown high, also the secretary. And to my right in descending order, Deputy Mayor Councillor Ward 1, Glen Fuel, Councillor Ward 2, and Eccasinsky, Councillor Ward 3, Mark Miller. Councillor Ward 4 is a Melinda Warren. Can I get approval of the agenda? I'm moving on to the second floor for that, please. Sorry, Melinda and Glen. And the addition is modifications of all to the agenda. I see none. I'm going to show hands those in support of approval of the agenda. That's unanimous and is carried. Approval of the minutes, I'm going to move on to the second floor for that, as well, please. Melinda and Glen. And the additions to that, Andy. Sorry, all right. I wanted to ask that on the last meeting, I asked for the accounts from which one we took the money for SSHI. And the comment was from here accounts, but we still didn't receive that information to council. Yeah, I've requested that from finance, well, follow up on those on that information. And how long are going to take? Because it's already a month. Yep, I'm not sure. I will follow up with them and get a timeline to get that information to council. Okay, thank you. Any other comments or additions for the approval agenda? Or the minutes, sorry. None. Then I get a show hands those in support of the approval of the committee of the whole minutes. November the 12th, 2024. As unanimous and is carried. And then we'll go to a question period there. And 15 minutes. And obviously it's going to be somebody online. There, Janet, you want to go first. Good. Hello, my name is Janet Nyland. And I'm from Oakbank. I have one question. It's item 8.2. It's your schedule of council meetings. I notice that there are 11 council meetings. For next year, I'm wondering why they're not being rescheduled. As they have been done in other other times. I'll for that to receive. At this point, we're just laying out the proposed schedule for council to review. Council, cancelations obviously are related to holidays or different conferences that council attends to. So typically closer to those dates if we want to change the committee of the whole to a council meeting if it's needed or vice versa. We can do that closer to by separate resolution. Well, that might work for you and maybe for council, but it's very. I'm not going to be a little bit awkward for citizens to know when meetings are going to be held and to plan to attend. Previously, you had often maybe a month or two ahead. Put in alternate dates, like for example. January 7th could it not be moved to another date. I just, I'm just there's more and more councilations. Tuesday isn't going to be a suitable day because of conflict with other things may be council reviews there. Organizational bylaw and changes the date they meet to Wednesday for example, like other municipalities. I'm just saying that. 11 meetings in a year seems like an awful lot to cancel. Does council agree with that or is are they willing to work with that? That's what we're going to discuss coming up here, but I personally haven't got a problem with that. It's just a way the schedule is sometimes we're not able to have those meetings to reschedule them as our CEO said we could we could do that maybe later on as it cuts closer. But that's just the time of this time of the year where it falls on so. Other councils and other RMs you refer to them who who you refer to. Well, a lot of council meetings are on Monday nights or on Wednesday nights they don't have to be on Tuesday. If if if you're conflicting with a lot of other. Organizational meetings it's something that council can look into. I mean, we're already the meetings are getting shorter and opportunities for the public are getting reduced. I just think this is one more step in in reducing public. Involvement with council. I would really appreciate you looking into alternatives for other than just simply counseling. 11 meetings. Well, that's that's 11 of how many meetings and that's for the entire year. So. And then the first it don't see a big issue with regards to that and like I say, I'm this council is going to discuss that later on. But your your your no notice is noted. There are 10 council meetings out of 24. You're counseling there's one planning meeting. So I'm just oh pardon me somewhere committee of the whole but. And council meetings are important I would suggest if you counsel a council meeting maybe refer to a committee of the whole date. As they seem to be shorter and not as. Complicated or involved for the public my comments are noted. Thank you. Thank you. Anybody else for questions so there Daniel. No good afternoon. My name is Daniel Page. I'm your computer science professor from Pine Ridge Road. So I'm come to ask questions about something that's happened before and again. And I have my first question is so I'm looking at the minutes. Bro November 12, 2024. The ones that were just approved. Now from what I know. My counselor passed along some comments and concerns around those minutes were those received by council. Yes. I speak for myself. Yes. So my second question is is I'm looking at the minutes that are on the arm website. Just at this moment. And there's a number there's at least two. Spelling mistakes down to the point of just straight up high post. And I've concerns that the minutes aren't being given the care that they're needed for accuracy as. And my comment my question is so I brought forward. So I prepared very carefully a document and I gave it to my counselor including a gave down to the edits the individual edits. Of specific parts for my this by part of the question period from that from that meeting where there's some again there's inaccuracies on what was said. And what I said and what I inquired and asked about. And what did the ask council. Why are you like why was it this consider and put before council and try to improve the document. Um, counselor Kaczynski sent a to us. Maybe he can he can answer. Your your questionnaire. And. Thank you. Yeah, I was pointed out that once we send that corrections to the our minutes they should be corrected and represented through. Meaning of what the residents are presenting to us not whatever we are. I don't know who take the minutes and you know interpreted the minute. So I agree with the doctor page that we should make those correction and you know. I'm sure that going forward we we having correct minutes of the council meeting. Thank you. Mark. Thank you Mr. Mayor and I would echo what to Councillor Kaczynski just said, but I actually think there might have been an administrative error. In the submission of those corrections because I have the document in front of me that calling may have received. And it says corrections for minutes for November 14th. And I think there are 24 so I have those in front of me and I think they are meant for November 12th right. Yeah. No 12th. Okay. So I think it's just a potential oversight but maybe the CEO can speak to that concern. I think we received the email from Councillor Kaczynski yesterday. Correct. Yes. With the requested changes. We've heard there's on to the assistance CAO reviewed them. We did correct spelling mistake that was pointed out. But we feel like question period. We've said this before. It's not a verbatim. You know, we try to summarize. Best the context that we we hear from the person. We've always refer people to the audio if they want to hear exactly what's spoken or they can attend the meeting in person. But we do our best to summarize the content that's provided during question period. And if I can add to that that was going to be my reply. It's the letter from or the email from the MSO. That's the municipal service officer there. It's we answered Mr. pages comments last time there and I'll answer them again. The points made our minutes are not to legal document and I'm not laid out the way that that way in the municipal act. Minutes will act only references that the CEO must ensure that the minutes of every council meeting are made without no to our comment. Minutes should be verbatim and that the should not reference individual points made. Personal observations or opinions made by council members. Minutes should not be recorded debate on the outcome decisions resolutions reports documents attached to the agenda show the information that was considered leading to the decision made. Question period should not be on the agenda personal opinions judgments or comments made by the attendees should should be avoided and not included in the minutes. As for your your comments there November the 14th I guess we we now know it's the 12th. You know you notice you note in dark blue or additional materials and comments to consider that's not up to you Mr. page to to to make those. Additions to that we we looked at the minutes there in the minutes are as per our municipal service officer. They're fine with me and have been for. For the two years that we've been here plus many many years before that that we're not going to change the the aspect of the minutes the minutes are just that there there are just a scope of what was reiterated on a certain mean minute of meetings or one meeting in this case here. And the change it now I think is. No is is not something we want to do spelling errors although it should be avoided is at the very best a point that does not take away from the meaning unless. This is a legal document something like a search warrant or warrant to obtain and so on like that spelling errors or critical this doesn't rise to that occasion. I hope that answers your question Mr. page. It doesn't be honest but I one more question. You use the word verbatim and now I'm an academic I understand what that word means can you explain to council what you mean by verbatim because I don't understand what you mean by verbatim what's. What is the definition verbatim that you're using. I don't know I could get I can get on Google here and look for verbatim but I'll tell you what I think it is verbatim is exactly what was stated. If I what I just said and the two seconds here it'll it'll have every F. And so on like that. I think I'm a good lady and the RM here has every of that I say in the term my conversations well that's verbatim everything exactly as stated. These are points that we want to get across. just so I guess I'll just ask one more question then. So just to be clear, I don't understand how any of the comments I have here. These are, well, first, just for context because not other people have this, the other people don't have this document. The first set of blue text, just for context for council, that's justifications for the changes needed on my question period comments because they are inaccurate and they make a logical, make a lot of logical assumptions that aren't actually true. Likewise, you wouldn't know what document I was talking about if you actually looked at the segment that's actually there. And it twists a couple things I did say. That's just a matter of truth. The second set of blue comments, those are ones just meant to help because there's comments that just lack of information on those components. But indeed, there's two typos, just be very clear. They're not actually changed in the minutes that are actually on the, on there right now that I just loaded up just for context. But my final question is very simple. Is does accuracy of minutes matter to council? I think it rises to a spelling errors. I don't think that's, although it should be avoided. It's not fatal at any aspect of this at all. It doesn't take away from the minutes at all. We'll try to avoid spelling errors. Mark, thank you Mr. Meron. Thank you, Dr. Page, for your comments on this because I think it's critical. I belong on a number of national and other boards and things like that. So we have a minute book. A minute book is a legal instrument that is a record of a recorded meeting. So I would differ with what was just explained. And I would say that minutes are absolutely critical in being accurate, precise, and just. And so yeah, my point of view is just one shared amongst five people here. But I think they could be enhanced. And I really, really appreciate you taking the time and effort to submit your corrections to council because I think it'll also stand as a record. And it should be table and put as a record for what the public has seen in this case. But minutes can always be improved. You know, the old moral of teaching is, you know, for things like this is a record less and then you have less to be accountable for. I don't like that motto. I think you should record more and provide more detail and precision to really give the tone. As you said, you felt that you are misrepresented. I know in 7.3 as well. I think some of my points weren't captured because I don't know that I think there is misrepresentation of information out there, but it goes on both sides. Right? You can't just accuse one side of providing misinformation when because it becomes very biased and very, how could I say one side? And so absolutely. But you know, at the end of the day, I hope we can do a better job in recording minutes. Thank you. And I'll end this off. We run out of and you got some. Go ahead. Yeah, so I want to point and out that if resident think that he was not correctly coded and he of all the rights to, you know, make a statement and correct them and we should accept that as a truth because if we can go back to the minutes, what was said to the audio and see what he said, then what's the problem to keep changing them? So the resident feel like, you know, he was and miscold it and everything was said by him, it's there according to that, you know, being truthful. Thank you. Okay. Also, I'll quickly summarize this and then we'll carry on. This is the second time where Dr. Paige has made the comments with regards to the minutes are correct. I said it the last time there, and I'm not going to reread the points there. The way we've been doing it, I would say for decades has has worked fine. I don't see any necessity to change it whatsoever if there's something in here that that's totally beyond the problematic stage. It goes against that's totally wrong. This doesn't rise at level at all. Then we'll one thing I do agree that there are some spelling errors, but I don't find that's a big deal whatsoever. It happens and maybe we'll try to not have these spelling errors there, but they don't take away from the document. I think we'll cut that off now because we'll well over our time here, and then we'll go to any other, is that the 50 minutes for sure, isn't it? Okay. Then what do we go to the agenda there? Let me find my notes. No delegations, no unfinished business. What do we get to 8.1 there? That's camera inventory program. Get to get a mover to seconder please. Linda and Glenn. So this is for information. I believe Sergeant Turner is going to come up and speak about the document to council. If that's okay. Just generally, if you can describe to council what exactly this inventory program is about. I'll tell you came to know about it and others that are doing it and what the benefit might be. Sure. Yeah. So while attending the Manitol Association, choose a police fall meeting company called Forest Green to the presentation and they provide solutions to police just to help us do our job better. One of the programs they pitched was a safe neighborhood camera registry program. So what it does is it provides a link onto the RM's website where residents can go on onto the secure login information. They'd have that and then they could log whether or not they have a public facing camera and whether or not they're willing to share that information with police should a crime occur in that area. So the police would have the login and we would get little bubbles all over the RM showing where a camera is and that would limit our time going door to door to do not contoxacy. If cameras are available and I had an answer and with this over the weekend, what a missing person and we spent about two and a half hours going door to door, you know, banks. So this could limit some of that back time and just go to Target at Hoses. That could help. It's a free program to the RM and it's paid through my possible Criminal Record Check portal for an online application. If the RM chooses to go that route, provides residents with the opportunity to just do a Criminal Record Check online through the RM's website instead of attending the RCMP. It also reduces the amount of Criminal Record Check the RCMP you would have to do. So there would be a charge to the online Criminal Record and the RM gets a portion of every Criminal Record Check that gets submitted through the portal and then that's how the Camera Adjusting Program is paid for. Questions any questions for council? Glamper? Yeah, I think it's a good thing, especially with what happened in New York here. Just recently, I'm sure they went through all bunch of videos to find the gentleman that shot that CEO when I realized that that's US, but and it can be the same with things happening and why not put a program together that helps that. And just also the side note I did consult the RCMP here and there's no problem with them putting a third party from more Crochet. Option. The only thing that that's linked would not provide is a vulnerable sector check, which they would still have to attend the RCMP for. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you for bringing this forward to council. Having returned from Nairobi Canyon not too long ago, they have cameras everywhere. They implement this. Now, as you know, as a police official, a enforcement officer, you know that this doesn't prevent crime, but it helps facilitate capturing as council fuel just indicated. How have you said that? Does it reach on any personal privacy issues? No, all. No, the feeds and the recting that video is not stored on the website whatsoever. All it is is just you fill it an application saying that you are willing to share your information with the police and it just provides a little bubble on a map. That's all it does. It doesn't. They're not required to testify. Should we pull any video? They can remove themselves from the camera just to program at any time with no penalty. So in your opinion, would it be a strong strong element to support the enforcement or the capture or the investigation that you have going forward with? Absolutely. It would streamline our investigation greatly because we don't have to drive around looking for cameras. We've still well because not everybody will use the service, but it can target us to go to certain locations instead of kind of doing a door to door. I think it would facilitate that. I have an organization that's on Main Street in Winnipeg and there was a murder not far from the premise and asked to use our camera for the investigation which led to the apprehension of the individual so far. I think this would absolutely facilitate that as long as there's no privacy breach. Not at all. The video footage doesn't get uploaded onto this site. It's literally just I live at 1, 2, 3 Main Street and I have a ring door bell camera on my garage and I'm willing to share the information. That's all we get. Thank you for your information. Once again, thank you for bringing this forward. I see a bit of a problem with it. There's lots of positives, but it says it says in there and I read it. The aspect there that they're trying to get it's a business. First of all, for this criminal records check but local indices has to be done at the detachment and this is a seepic issue there. The fact that it states that there will not be required for court, this is a murder something in the range nothing higher than a murder. Defense can look to the contest, the downloading and given it to the police. That's my problem. It's accurate because 99 out of 100 times all it is is going to be looking for the missing person. It's extremely important. It comes down to a murder. The guarantee that defense is going to want to know who's house that came from from what kind of computer has been tampered with in the whole nine years. Because of that's integral to a investigation. They're going to be season the hard drive. I don't want to get into the weeds of that. Everything else is an exceptional idea. I commend you for doing that. That one little nuance there, the proprietary rates and so on to that event. That I guess that we could that could be figured out later on. I don't want to make one small thing a blurb that will happen. It's like a 100 years or something like that. I shouldn't say that because it happens more often than not. That's not accurate in my opinion. I'm not totally accurate. I should say, but for what it does, it solves a lot of problems. I may have very much for that. Any other questions at all? Thank you for presentation. Can we make a pilot project in industrial area and see how that works? If we have a comment on that? Like through this business? Yeah. I'm not sure if they would just do it to a specific location. I could ask them. But the transgotten industrial park being part of the municipality would have access just like a resident in Old Bank or in Old Wood. So all the businesses could make that they have cameras as well. Because I remember we have meeting with the owners of the businesses there. And we suggested to them to play some cameras there. I was going to mention that following that meeting, I know they were looking at a neighborhood watch program. We would offer this service to that area as well. Anyone that has a camera could register their camera. Good work with Springfield Police and the RCMP. I know there's other communities using this. Do you recall? Morton, I'll tool in our using it. And I think they're getting burden on board right now. And the criminal records are done through Brandon. Police service. Through this company here? Yeah. They partner with Brandon police to do the criminal or their checks. I've been out of the game for a while, but it doesn't not help you down at your detached or level. No, it can be done online. Like if you have no criminal criminal records check for the armistory field right now, you can even do one on the commission airs website. Call, right? There's a cost to it. Yeah. So it depends if you want to do it online or in person into detachment. So the local winters he checks are done here. Vulnerable sector checks would be done. Vulnerable sector checks would be done here. So the online portal would not allow you to get a vulnerable sector. So if you require that for your volunteer or your employment, whatever, you would still need to attend the RCMP detachment. So how much is this cost? The registry and the municipality? Yeah. Nothing. They make their money if somebody utilizes the criminal record check portal, right? Because there's a cost to the resident to get a criminal record check. The arm gets a portion, Brandon police get a portion and the company gets a portion. But there's no annual cost to the RCMP detachment. So all the state neighborhood, the business there knows that there's a camera 123 main street and 223 main street and so on like that. Okay. There's no cost for the camera program like they said it's it's a subsidy of the criminal record check program. Can you elaborate more what can a record check? We're going to do the president so they are aware of all that you've been listening. Just a criminal record check as as a whole, you know hockey teams. If you're volunteering for a hockey team, you need a criminal record check, you have vulnerable sector check. Certain employment needs a criminal record check. All we do is just run a criminal history. The RCMP does it right now. Thank you. Another question. All right. Thanks. Sorry. You're you got the next one. So you got the one there. I'm just kidding. Okay. One. We go to item e.0.2 as proposed council schedule move on to seconder for that, please. Melinda and Glenn. So we've just laid out the 2025 proposed council schedule. Just basically looking at any conferences that were aware of throughout the year. Obviously holidays that affect the council schedule. So hearing that there's concerns with the number of council meetings being cancelled. Councils never asked us to look at different days of the week. Typically when you have a conference like an AMM, it's you know two or three days. So it's hard to even reschedule that council meeting during that week when council's attending these conferences. But we're open to council suggestions. If you feel there's too many cancellations or you want to look at alternate dates, typically will will change a committee of the whole to a council meeting or reschedule to a later week if we can during that month. Mark. Thank you Mr. Mayor. I'm not opposed to cancel these meetings because I think to some degree if we add on items to the next agenda, it usually doesn't cause too much havoc for most part. In fact, some of our meetings are quite short. And in the instance that there is an overloaded agenda, is it not possible that we as council can interject and say, hey, maybe we do need a meeting prior to or adimating as we go. But just to have a meeting just to, you know, for a half an hour or two an hour whatever, just to say we had a meeting. I don't think there's any value to that like, the most. Yeah, we can book special meetings in different situations where there's timelines or our meetings so don't line up. We can book a special meeting at any time and give that advertisement to the public. So. And can I get the explanation or are we constantly in January 7th? Are we still on holidays? So staff do not come back to the office till January 2nd and because we close for that stretch between the 24th and the 2nd, there might not be a lot of business for us to add to that first meeting. So we just we had talked council previously about possibly extending that break with council meetings and there was general agreement. So this is just proposed. If you want to have that January 7th meeting, we can definitely book that. So. Can administration work on it or that meeting before the Christmas and something on agenda, if president's complained and we should think it's, you know, respond to it. And I haven't had any complaints, you want to be compliant. We've had this from Mrs. Nylon there. If there's not enough for January 7th to make it worthwhile meeting, I don't see any issue why we would we would do something to add it as much on there when there's nothing to be added. You know what I mean? If it's going to be a short short meeting, then a meeting for the sake of a meeting is not productive time. I feel like Len? Yeah, I was just going to say the same thing that a meeting to just just have a meeting for a meeting doesn't make sense to me. I would sooner have a special meeting put in or a scheduled meeting I had to be added when there's lots on the agenda, then there's more sense to adding that in my opinion just to have a meeting. I don't see a reason just to have a meeting if there's nothing on there. Thank you. And I know what are we going to know now that they're not going to be nothing on for the meeting. We we determined now or it ended up that they're not going to be nothing for that meeting. That's what Pauline was. Well, we have two more meetings this year, January or sorry, December 17th and 19th planning meeting and then we close from the 24th to the second. So I know other staff members are extending their holidays to that full week. So I'm not going to have a lot of staff reports or requests for that January 7th meeting. So if Council has items, I'm not aware of them, but send them to me and we can look at booking that meeting if it's required. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I just want to add to what has been said here is that very rarely in fact, of all our meetings, I don't think we've ever gone to the limit maybe one time to 10 or 10 30. So we can always load up the meeting. I mean, I don't it's more use of our time and stuff more efficiency. I would echo again, what everybody's pretty much said here. Okay. I think that's basically it there. I know other RMs and I hate using the term other RMs because the UNRM work in turn about is ours. But that said, many take the summer off. We're too big and too busy for that, but I'm just too, you know, I hate to word council, but it's appropriate for this thing here. It's not that it's Council. It's just that we're deferring it there because there's nothing to be added on there. And for the reasons AMM planning conference, FCM conference, remember and stay in Seoul. That's just the way that the schedule works in Canada day. So that's that's the majority. If you had to look at all the the reason to rationale, it's not just because of the entire day. I don't think we want to have a meeting. This is all supported cancellations. I just have one more point. If you don't mind, so obviously Mondays are not a great day because a lot of the holidays fall on the Mondays. So those don't work for council meetings. When we did committee appointments, we had asked council to provide us with all their committee dates that they meet. And I find a lot of those meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays already. So we're looking at your other committees that you sit on and a lot of the conflict Tuesday seems to be the free day for council to meet. So that's why we haven't proposed and I don't believe council's looked at proposing a different date to meet. So okay. And let's just other questions. Can I get a show hands? Those in support of the proposed council scheduled changes. As you know, I'm just curious. Then we'll get to 8.3 can I get a mover and a seconder for dogwood drives park in restrictions? Melinda and Patrick. The council recalls we had received some correspondence for a resident that lived on dogwood drive. Currently there is parking restrictions within the development and servicing agreement for this street that does not allow parking on either side of the street. And so that's been causing I guess some concerns with residents and when they have visitors and they notice the only street in oak bank that has these restrictions. This was a previous council decision that was made during the development agreement negotiations because of the size of the lots. So the developer was on side with this parking restriction being implemented. Now when people buy lots, it's up to either the developer, the builder, the real estate agent to provide this information to buyers. Apparently not everyone was aware of these restrictions. So now they're living with that restriction without knowing it at the time of purchase. So we did send out a letter to the 18 properties on dogwood drive. We received 15 letters back and we basically asked them if they supported amending the development agreement to allow parking on one side of the street. 14 were in support of the amendment. One was against the amendment and three we did not hear back from. So we're just providing this information to council. At this point, if council wants to provide direction to amend this development agreement, we could definitely bring that back to a future council meeting for council devote on. So at this point it's just for information for council and if you want to direct us to bring it back, I would need that direction from council. Good. Yeah, so I've heard from a few residents in that area on that street and I would recommend that we bring it back to look at the development agreement to be amended. I'm in support when I see 14 in support. Three did not respond. So again, that's not a yes or no and one being against. So I think it's pretty high. And then when I look at other streets, for examples, I have done that also in other municipalities and I don't see a problem with having as parking on one side of the street at this time. Mark, thank you, Ms. Mair. I'd like to support what council are few recommends on this. Thank you. And for the record, I support it as well. Melinda's. So that's your unanimous. So then while we bring back sometime in the future, rather, then we can discuss the changes. Yeah, we can add that to a future meeting then. Okay. Now I'll go to a close meeting. Can I get a mover and a second? I'll go to the close meeting, please. Melinda and Patrick. And we'll go to close meeting at 139 PM. Thank you. We're going to come out of close meeting at two o wait PM. I'm going to move on to second and come out of close meeting. Mark and Glenn. And I've gotten very mind agenda there. Oh, okay. Then we're prepared to adjourn. Nothing else to be added from close meeting. So a two o eight PM will adjourn as well. Thank you.", "summary": "**Part 1 Summary:**\n Good afternoon. And 15 minutes.

This is the arm spring field of meeting in agenda for April the first day. It's a 25 council meeting is starting at exactly six PM. I'm a mayor Patrick Terian for the arm spring field. I'll introduce council as we call the order. Deputy Mayor Councillor Ward 1 is a Glen Fuel. Next will be a council of Ward 2 is Andy Kaczynski. Next will be a council of Ward 3 is a council of Mark Miller. Next will be a council of Ward 4 is Melinda Warren. I'll go to land acknowledgments there. The arm spring field acknowledges that we are gathered on ancestral lands. Treaty 1 territory, traditional territory and Ashnabi, Creoji, Dakota, Denny Peoples, and the National Homeland of the Red River Mati. Then we'll get into item 4. That's the approval of the agenda. Can I get a mover in a second for that to please? Linda and Glen. There are additions to the agenda. I see none. Can I get a show hands? Those in the pool of the agenda? That is carried. The adoption of the minutes. I have number 5. I move on a second. Patrick and Melinda. The questions are concerns. Authorations to adopt on the minutes for Mark's 18th. The last meeting. March 18th. Number 11.10. It was just a comment about the amount of good roads. We discussed that we had a couple winners. I just want to say again that it was the bookers from Anola and the wild earth farms. The meanster family from the wild earth farms. They will be accepting their award on April 14th. Thank you for letting us know that. With that said, there can I get a show hands. Those in support adoption of the minutes. March 18th. The unanimous in his carried. Then we'll go to reports. This is a six point one. Move on a second. Mark and Andy. Questions? Thank you, Mayor. Just some supplementary information to the reports. I want to celebrate the S.H.I. press release. I won't read that into the record. I think our website has it already. There's going to be a new 54 unit. Do-go-l place assisted living residents. This is a long time coming. It's a positive initiative. There's been such incredible hard work by Leslie Thompson, Beverly, and Randy, and the whole group. I just applaud them as you did in our meeting. I'm thankful to the efforts that they've put forth. I just a couple of other things that I'd like to highlight. I think it's pertinent to our municipality. One of them being that countries are now actually beginning to ban fluoride in their water. Utah is the latest state to do that. My question is, actually prior to that, I just want to put on the record that countries that have rejected or discontinued water fluorination are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. So my question here, and I don't need the answer right here now, but I would like to pose it. Does Springfield add fluoride into pipe water at present to homes in Oakbank, Dukele, and all are anywhere else that we have? So if I could table that, it's becoming a known health issue. I want to make sure that we're on top of that. The second item that I have is actually has to do with arsenic in drinking water. There's draft guidelines for Canadian drinking water quality that has been issued by Health Canada. And the deadline for input by Canadians is May 6, 2025. So I would encourage everyone that has some concern or wants to see what Health Canada is suggesting to go to Health Canada website and the International Agency for Research on Cancer because they consider arsenic a human cancer causing agents. They're actually looking to reduce arsenic and drinking water by 50% so that's hugely significant. And so I want to make sure that our municipality, if we are monitoring arsenic in our water that is disclosed and it's known to the residents, Health Canada actually also encourages everyone that has a well to test the arsenic in their water. And I believe at the current rate at $75 per resident to do that. So I'm hopeful that in once the new draft guidelines or the guidelines come into effect on a national level, perhaps the provinces or the health agencies of each province will support those who are on well water because we want to protect citizens. Human Health is a very critical aspect and most of the residents in the arm of Springfield of course get their drinking water from from our aquifer and that doesn't say the people who are on pipe water don't because it comes from the same source so that's critically important. And just a couple of other quick items that I'd like to raise March 12. I'm happy to say that the RM hosted an open house at the Lincrest Airport. I'm kind of disappointed that there was only five people who participated. If we were to do a post-mortem because I think it's important for us to continue to hosties and I believe we are committed to doing that. I think maybe we should look at why we had such a poor turnout. I don't think because it was at Lincrest Airport necessarily. Was it because there was a competing jet-scape? Was it because there wasn't enough notice to people? Was it because social media wasn't used? I don't know. All I'm saying is I know when Calcer Cachinsky and I did host three meetings previously. We had packtouses and hundreds of people attend. Why we can only get five people is kind of beyond my uses a lot of our time and obviously a lot of the resources of our council to book that into have that meeting. And the final item has to do actually with Terrients report just a question. On March 20th you had a meeting with the WMR. I think you may have done that on Zoom but you can clarify that. I just wanted to know we already spend a membership fee upwards of $18,000 for the WMR and it's mandatory and it's not a choice item which is another issue but what I'm also concerned about is there's also our resources being put into that too. Was there a podium or is there an extra cost for you to participate in that? Did you do you know if you claimed a podium? Was it on Zoom? Was it on Teams? If you can clarify that be very much appreciated. Thank you. Usually if I was on Zoom I would say Zoom but I'll have to confirm whether that was or not. I know another meeting I went on Zoom. I was feeling ill the one of these there so I can't give you a definite answer but I'll look at my indemnity form and the confirmed that with you. Are there questions from council? Then if all the questions are done with the elected officials item 6.1 can you go to show hands those and support or identifying the election officials report that is unanimous and is carried. And then we'll go to 6.2 that's the departmental reports. Can I get a mover and a second or for departmental reports? Glenn and Nammalinda. With that I had a few questions there. Have we got to me know who's on Zoom there? As we'll wait ahead of the game here we can't really start with Mrs. Lilland until 6.30 we could go to something else there maybe a consent agenda but we're on department reports now I had a question with regards to ask at management or maybe a comment in a question. I found it very well done. No matter the great job and I used to see that said management is very in tune with climate change and using resiliency to to abate it to iEa Manitoba Natural Resources Community Tree Plant and the growing Canada canopy program. There we do in this RM get involved with that by giving out pre-trees. One of that P calling in May sometime usually. Yeah typically that's done in May. Yeah that's that's an excellent program we always seem to have some less left over but I hope we plant all those trees there so that's more of a comment towards the Nomar a really good job. Fire it seems it's getting slower there for this report here but that's only going to pick up with the weather starts getting warmer and becoming drier and grass grass fires are going to be out there. We do have a new grass fire truck but I throw that in there as well. Public works in our work and group discussions the topic of One purpose use age was discussed that's reference equipment there with the director Amoffit the vehicles are equipment now that we we buy we try to you know I'm going to speak on behalf of the director of the plane there they have to be more resilient and have a dual purpose there the days of just having one function there obviously that's going to be the case there but if we can utilize the function out being a couple ways three ways or wherever it is so that's that's what we're looking for because costs repairs and maintenance are extremely high. I think now a greater is almost $700,000 and that's just that's just a absorbent amount of money but that's what everybody is paying there so it's evident from what I have seen that we're doing an excellent job at take care of our equipment and always looking for the to get the equipment to using its functions and dual purpose and that's all I had with regards to that any questions or comments further from council by seeing none can I get a show hands those are supportive of identifying the departmental reports. I'm so carried. We got 18 minutes before we get to our Mrs. Laund maybe we can do consent agenda council okay with skipping and doing consent agenda and I see a yes on that can I get a mover and a seconder for the consent agenda please that's item as 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 so move on a seconder please mark him Melinda. Whereas a consent agenda has been submitted consisting of seven items be resolved that the said consent agenda be received is information. I'm sorry just questions and I see none they're going to get a show hands those are supportive of the consent agenda as unanimous and it is carried. Then maybe we can we still got 17 minutes new business then if we can go to 11.1 is Council okay with skipping to 11.1. I see that it's a consent there. Simonton rolled the reduction there and move on a seconder for 11.1 the summit in road Mark and Melinda or I'm sorry I blend in Melinda. Here is all the council of the arm a springfield approved the reduction on speed along the Signington road between the perimeter highway 101 and Naven Road to be posted at 70 kilometers an hour. Councillor fuel this was a discussion that we all had there and we we had a very intense traffic study for this area here and even though many of the I would say vast majority of the speeds were under the speed limit of 90. Council felt that 90 was a little bit too fast even though most people were doing under 90 and in fact they're doing around in the 70s there for the most part there's one area where they're actually doing 81 but that was a very brief area I like to say what it was but I don't remember but reducing it to a 70 is an appropriate speed in my mind to hear there's a few roads like that so this is nice that we've actually approached this and I want to mention the name of our the lady who brought this forward there if I remember it I say it but I didn't get permission to say it in any case there so I think it's a it's a good safety measure within the arm or springfield introduced at the 70 kilometers an hour so with that you have to read a resolution but I didn't kind of just go to show hands for 11.1 simultaneously rolled speed reduction that is unanimous and is carried then if we can go to 11.2 that's 25 a springfield public library level mover and a secular Patrick and Glenn we resolve that council approved the 2025 springfield public library level and the amount of 155254 dollars any questions from council with regards to 11.2 springfield level I see none I got to show hands of those in support of 11.2 as unanimous and is so carried I think we still have time for 11.3 that's a water appropriations we got to 1 2 3 4 5 items on here actually 4 but there's 5 down here 5 oh oh I'm sorry yeah I was in it okay can I get a show of hand or a a mover and a second for water appropriations please a Melinda and Patrick so just maybe go through the request with council as the first request is for Dawson track cycling fundraising so this is a first annual cycling fundraiser a track along the historic Dawson trail from Wenapeg to Richard there's different opportunities to support starting at $500 for sponsorship $1000 but any donation over $20 is eligible for a tax receipt at notes so it's up to council we have not obviously donated to this before as it's the first so it's coming to trust and donating to that I'm not I like what they presented there I would be for $75 the 50 $50 okay then there's the Dawson track support request what you're talking to me here next request is you know LeBand parents association for a ban trip they're requesting $500 I'm all for this Melinda you want to talk about there are council or more I the lady approached me by email and I know we've given to other banned programs in Springfield and so I would give a hundred or what did we say we did last 150 for the other they're looking for $500 yeah they're requesting $500 I give a just to make it on the even I would give 150 then okay I'm gonna put that yeah oh do hundred other same as Melinda okay and the third request is from Springfield Minor Baseball again they're requesting different sponsorships the grants lamb sponsor for a thousand home run sponsor for 500 base hit sponsor for 250 uh councilor did we give to the last year as well I did not look that up oh so um and Christie is looking that up for me now okay if if I could just add into that I know Springfield Minor Baseball well for my kids or into the baseball there very well organized very well initiative in our community there I I speak in the coached a little bit with the Minor Baseball what I can do I wasn't a baseball all out of player but that said this community is very strong history you have with with baseball and I'm for contributing um five hundred dollars towards that as a total or you yourself oh I thought maybe total hundred dollars please you're good with that okay thanks for clarifying that okay uh be resolved that the following 2025 order preparations be approved and the LeBan parents association 600 dollars Springfield Minor Baseball Association $500 and Dawson Trek cycling fundraiser $325 I'm ready good with that I was only in the hands up there gonna get a show hands those and supported the water appropriations under those mounts and it's so carried um six 20 so if we can get to 11.4 that's the all four local golf tournament multi chamber event gonna get a move on a second or four 11.4 please that's a counselor Warren and Terian be resolved that all of council be delegated to attend the all four local golf tournament being held June 19th and so Kirk at their discretion I guess I'm on the record I'm not a golfer there but I think it's a good initiative there this is the first year I believe as well so I was support in total of 750 their contribution there let's guess that's for the lunch sponsorship label there and it gives us all the our logo is out on the the course and so on like that it's all the fine down there so I'm willing to give 125 I guess myself gonna so Warren yeah yes yeah oh as come in the council is gonna attend that golf tournament I'm not I am not I'm probably not gonna golf but I think I'll go there just to to mingle a little bit oh I'll climb your moves to get I'm just kind of looking for you know I get the lunch sponsor but you know it's also $500 to me is a pretty good deal also you have corporate signage by every T so there's 18 times that you're seeing our sponsorship where lunch you're only seeing it once per table so I think we would get more out of it with a signage by T just again for notoriety of the arm a springfield and being a multi event you know it's hopefully will track some business here and that will look at springfield for business you give it that too so I'll amend mine to $100 and the other councils I'd give a hundred yeah I'll give a hundred too council or kizinski in emerald well I won't be attending so I don't know if I should contribute you have to it so it's I know our signage gonna be there but what do we gonna achieve by that are we gonna draw on business or what are you gonna be just being visible that's about it being visible and there's gonna be multiple businesses there for sure I would think golfing being that it's done by the chamber and it's there's gonna be multiple chamber there bozier, silker, and ourselves so I believe you know again it's a good cause for that reason I don't want to speak on behalf of myself so yeah well I want to be contribute yeah I'm gonna pass on this but I wish councilor fuel a hole in one yeah I'm so waiting for that one all right let's just have a hearing if he gets a hole one then we're gonna readjust this okay so councilors warn fuel in myself a hundred dollars each okay so just to clarify the resolution was read that the it was all that all of council be delegated to attend the all four local golf tournament being held June 19th and silker get their discretion so if I could just confirm that the mover councilor warn and secondary councilor Terran can amend this resolution to include and be it for the result that council provide a five hundred dollars towards a whole sponsorship so yeah I thought it was for sponsorship as well they had the categories one are the the 250 550 on the right there so this is just for attending their then I don't know of the asking for money as well well councilor saved an invite to attend and then there's also the sponsorship opportunities so you have the option to do either or both then with that clarify there I don't think that changes in what is mind and will 300 dollars will go towards that so just providing 300 dollars to the yeah and the different levels I haven't got it on here is a 500 dollars is the the lowest 500 250,000, 750 and 150 okay then I'll put in 300 dollars to make it a 500 dollar one there okay for boxes there or whatever they call those things I may change remind I may start getting into golf a little bit more but I find it a very frustrating game with the hockey stick yeah but I'm a goalie I take Pax and a head a so that's which is Dumber I think we can go to could I get a vote with regards to item 11.4 all four local golf tournament that would be councilor Warren fuel and the terran those opposed that would be councilor's Miller and Kazinsky so passed I think we three minutes early I think and I know everybody is here we can go to delegations there Mrs. LaLonda you are ready even three minutes early turn along oh bank I like to thank you for the opportunity to speak on by law 13 or two for the business launch sort of sort of interruption there have we have started your time there but it's a ten minutes for your your delegation there and we'll give you will give you a warning a two minutes or something Kristi will tell you that but no worries I won't need it I don't think okay sorry about that okay so I'm not the one of the opportunities to speak on by law 13 dash zero two additional sales manager tax sales manager I don't see a need for another employee to address this issue since there's so cute tax sales the CEO and administration usually used to handle this also I haven't been on council for a while but if my memory serves people correctly I don't think a by law can be changed by a resolution in my my 12 years on council there were any tax sales residents came in it's a last minute to pay or in rare cases they were granted a payment method given to them for extra time to to make the payments so I'm just are we expecting that the huge property assessment increases to lead because of more for closures in the past large increases in assessments recounted by little by just decreasing the the mill rate and sunrise school division has recently done not to help out the citizens my question is is this something that council would consider the first question man is the foreclosures do we expect more foreclosures that was your question I was wondering if that's why we're getting another employee which we either still we need because you're expecting more for closures because of the increased assessment I think those three questions I'll refer to for a CEO okay so just to clarify we're not amending the by law the by law was just attached for information so it's a resolution just appointing an additional tax sales managers name from tax service to run the tax sale process for the armistring field we've been using tax service since 2013 to do that typically we start with about 400 properties that are in tax sale every year that windows down to about 50 and by the time the tax sale date actually comes about we I don't think we've had too many I think this year we had two properties in tax sale but there is quite a detailed process so it's not something that staff can take on any longer because of the amount of work that's required and the details to meet all the deadlines and all the filings that are required so we typically have the same amount of properties that go into tax sale and the same that end up actually at the tax sale date so are there more regulations now to do the paper work and there were in 2013 no but we've been using tax service since 2013 every year for the tax sale process of about 2012 that but that's changed my question I guess I think there was issues when the RM was doing it that we weren't able to complete that required information and meet all the deadlines just because it's it's basically a full-time job okay okay and well I guess my one question that I wanted to answer and I don't know if the mayor wants to address that or or everybody but was the but that does decreasing the mill rate to make it more reasonable for citizens since we have said to large assessment increase that's something we'll have to discuss with council certainly not going to be able to give it an answer on that no I just want to if you would consider it I think we're always looking to consider the lower taxes and lower the mill rates I think that's that goes without saying whether it's achievable that's a little after the term in that well it's been done other times and you know when there's been a huge impact on our residents so I just thought of be something to look at again thank you very much ma'am thank you thank you then we can go to item 7.2 that'll be Mrs. Nylon you say your name and your address please I'm Jonathan O'Bank good evening I am going to explain to you that I am not sick I have a chronic cough I'm trying to control it with the cough candy and I have water here but there's no germs as my point you know so I'd like to make a presentation on the proposed second reading to buy law number 254 the fee in charges by law usually the public doesn't get too concerned about this typical bylaw but I think it's important that council consider some of the ramifications and implications of some of the proposed changes to the existing fee in charges bylaw my intention is simply to provide a constructive perspective on a few points in the bylaw and it's hope that council keeps an open mind and considers the argument and not simply dismiss it I don't know how much council has discussed these changes in the working group meeting but at the first reading there was no discussion before the public and I'm not sure if you understand that there could be some negative consequences by passing the proposed bylaw as written my first point is that council is proposing a significant tax change from the previous bylaw number 2114 in that bylaw there were three schedules A, B and C that applied to specified years and show sliding creases to some permit licenses or levies and this proposed bylaw there's only one schedule that will apply to 2025 but on point three it also allows council from time to time by resolution to amend the schedule I think that this changes less effective and unclear as council considered that the fees and charges bylaw is posted on the website and maybe one of the most viewed bylaws by residents wanting to know the cost of projects like resolutions that may change fees may not be clearly published and are usually only for a minor change not a complete schedule change I would suggest that council reconsider and return to the format set out in bylaw 2114 and have three schedules and a three year graded rate increase my second point is that council is removing the animal control section from this bylaw but does not propose another bylaw yet to replace it there will be no authority in place until such a new bylaw is adopted I would suggest that council holds off at least third reading until an animal licensing bylaw is in place the third point relates to the capital levies charges to new development it's on page nine of your bylaw it's rare for me to be promoting higher fees but I feel for the capital water levie in the capital sewer levie that council reconsider the slight increase to these two areas at the last council meeting I did submit some comments about this and the CAO then attached to the agenda and compared and review with nine other municipalities that are in the capital region it shows higher fees for just just wait a sec we lost either yeah I would go back just a little bit no still don't hear I believe you uh you you you you you interesting you you you you you you you you you can you hear me now okay so assuming that's not part of my 10 minutes you I'm going to go back to at the last council meeting I did submit some comments about this in the CO then attached to the agenda a comparative review with nine other municipalities that are in the capital region it shows higher fees for e-saint Paul McDonald and headingly and the others appears slightly lower that my concern about this comparison is that it does not compare apples with apples St. Clements and West Saint Paul for example don't have a sewer livy we don't know why but perhaps it's because there's another method of funding wastewater disposal given that council is proposing significant investment and borrowing infrastructure for the dows and the regional lagoon I would suggest that the measuring the measuring stick that you use to set these rates is different historically speaking the levees applied to new development were in part to cover some of the costs of existing infrastructure that's like buying into the infrastructure that existing tax payers have funded and also contributing towards future upgrades and expansion that the new development for the most part creates up to now upgrades have only been in the low millions of dollars but now they're going to cost multiples of tens of millions of dollars it doesn't seem fair or even reasonable that everyone currently living in Springfield will have to pay for these infrastructure upgrades that are due to new development and that new development isn't footing a larger share of the bill I think it was that Stanteck did a review of rates a few years ago and I would suggest that they are another company be hired to determine what an appropriate levy would be instead of just increasing the existing rate by a few dollars My last point is on the record search fee and I think my comments that the last meeting were unclear maybe even incorrect there is no change to the rates from the previous bylaw but I'm worried that the general office record search is not clearly defined some records are required to be accessible to the public by statute or regulation so hourly fee excuse me should be applied to them other than copying of course other records may be accessible by policy of council and I will admit that the general office usually has applied me with copies of minutes and bylaws without any hourly fee but as written this charge is not clear perhaps a clear policy as suggested by the province about which records are accessible and when fees would apply could clear up any misinterpretation that's my first presentation Thank you I can talk to the director with regards to the fees and the CEO can take the rest of the questions there I think he says on what dog bylaw fees I'll talk to the IR fees so we have to weigh out the fees there to so that we're competitive with other RMs there so the increments are relatively small so that's the main reason behind that I would think that we're always in the competition with TASHA and developers there so our levies are I think well within that bounce and all the current to our CEO for the next few questions Could I respond to your comments? Sure I guess you missed my point because you did a survey and you're sort of in the middle already so we're still being competitive but we are also doing we're charging other levies on other things that other municipalities aren't for streetlights and streets and different things if our main focus should be on our sewer and water that's where the levies should be I just want the new development to pay a share of what the tax payer is going to have to fund and if it's like I don't think your argument of being competitive is substantiated by the documents you gave me or that you showed Thank you Your other questions in RCO can look at that So you mentioned animal control so I just want to let you know that we do have an animal control by law 1803 that sets out those fines as well we've include that in by law 1918 which is our main soapil by law enforcement act by law and that has the fines there as well so the fines are set and we go through those by laws to issue them so this one is setting the license fees for animals and they're not in those other by laws they are in those by laws as well the license fees correct you said fines I'm sorry sorry yeah license and fines are all in both of those by law so they're covered elsewhere thank you Development levies so actually there's a quite extensive review being done by internal staff now the recommendation was to keep the levies the same I felt that we needed to keep increasing by little bit so that it wasn't just a huge increase so it was my decision to increase what we did just so that when they come back with accurate numbers for the increase it's not such a hit at once so we are planning that's why we did one schedule this year so that we can come back with those fees that whole comparable document for council to review and then we can set new fees for 26 and going forward I appreciate what you're saying except that rate you're increasing is not going to be the amount that attacks payer is going to pay for the dow's borrowing levy for example it was just a subjective number you used yeah so the number we used was based on the projects and population and there's a whole formula and I can't even pretend to understand it that would have to be our staff that come and review that but right now we have not approved developments that are looking into the new water system yet so currently we're still using the current capacity so we felt comfortable charging the current rates so those developments that are still using current capacity so we're at that brain canal that we're saying no more until the new fees are set and we have that comparison done so then two comments one of the fifty dollars or what you that was not just a random number the fifty dollars the increase that you're proposing for the levy for the water well our plan was to increase it by five hundred dollars each year but they those are doing the review said we shouldn't increase now right now and I wasn't comfortable not putting any increase at all okay and the last point is what you propose about resolutions amending this is that just in there for this one year and then you'll read through all the rates again so typically we have that condition in there so that if there is rates that come up and we don't have it in there we can add those by resolution but typically we're not going to be amending rates that are currently in there until we do a new complete schedule okay thank you just a comment this is awful can I can hear the echo that was joke I didn't hear it no I just sort of oh he was bored can I start with the second one now sure okay now I did time this at home I if I don't get interruptions and I don't offer something I will be under ten minutes so I'll go while I'm still doing okay the arm is good evening I'd like to start with a few reminders for council the arm is Springfield mission statement for example the arm provides high quality municipal services to our community through effective leadership and safe sustainable operating practices you're guiding principles state behaviors and actions be exemplified by government administration community members of Springfield accountability transparency fairness and integrity lead by example safety public service and teamwork in the 2022 council members guide the document provided to all council members when they were elected and it was produced by the province says that municipalities are mature governments which are democratically accountable to their citizens and responsible for delivering public services it goes on to say that minutes council minutes are the official public record of council's decisions and are normally taken by your CIO minutes must be made available to the public in a timely fashion and are typically posted on the municipal websites minutes do not include statements are debate and they are a record of decisions only I remind you of these points because council actions seem to be forgetting the rules and being accountable at times I'm speaking about the last planning meeting held on March 18 where you chose to proceed with a public hearing even after the matter of the minutes of the January 23 meeting which had been adopted by council on February 27 indicated that the public representation had been closed you did not consider the minutes as important the CIO even stated that minutes are not a legal document and not verbatim she advised council to proceed with the second public hearing because it had been advertised not only were the minutes of January 23 and air so as the CIO's advice I've attached for you or it was on the agenda a copy of the federal provincial territorial initiative document called Growing Forward 2 it's found on the web it states that under the corporations act minutes are a legal requirement for all organizations registered as a corporation to keep accurate meeting minutes board approved meeting minutes serve as a legal record of what actually occurred at a meeting and they are admissible as evidence in court they show evidence that the board actions were according to proper procedure outlined in the organizations by law when I registered online to be a delegation tonight or a delegate tonight I found out that I could only attach one document to the form so I also found on the provincial province of Manor Tobbe website a forms portal appendix d talking about regular minutes with a Q&A I have copies for council but I would like to read out a few excerpts question what are the Robert's rules for a meeting minutes Robert's rules section 48 one dash 16 state that the minutes should contain mainly a record of what was done at the meeting not what was said by the members minutes are not transcript of meetings rather the document contains a record of actions taken by the body organized by the meetings order of business agenda next question what are minutes in government minutes are the written record of all actions in a meeting including city council meetings meetings held by any government agency or any committee of the government agency that require minutes to ensure that these agencies or committees follow the law next question to meeting minutes need to be approved yes as the organization must approve minutes of what happened at the last meeting the meeting minutes are the only the approved version of meeting minutes is considered a legal record next question do meeting minutes have to be verbatim word for word accounts meeting minutes should not be verbatim the goal isn't to recount every director everything director said exactly as they said it but to give a clear overview of what the issue was what points were raised and what more decided when they decided question what happens if you disagree with the minutes of a meeting if any changes are corrections are offered to the minutes a motion must be made seconded and passed with a vote they must provide the exact wording for their suggestion if a member does not approve of the proposed correction they can make a motion to amend the minutes with an alternative correction last question is can meeting minutes be changed after approval board members are meeting participants may suggest or request amendments to meeting minutes at any time meeting minutes may be amended before or after the minutes have been formally adopted perhaps this does not seem to be important information to council but I can assure you it is important to me and a number of other taxpayers who expect council to behave in the exemplified manner to be accountable transparent and follow the democratic the past laws I have checked the audio and of January 23rd and the minutes were incorrect the chair did not close the evidentiary portion of the meeting has recorded but council approved the minutes and until they are legally changed minutes they are the legal record and would be a missible admissible in court I might remind you that this was not just any meeting it was a public hearing about a development plan amendment that now has to receive ministerial approval before third reading council should not have just ignored the issue of the erroneous minutes you should have taken the proper steps to correct the erroneous minutes and do it before moving forward no matter how much you wanted the issue to move on or go away the minutes of January 23rd as they stand are the legal record until council goes through the process to change them imagine what would have happened if council had voted to deny the amendment the applicant would have had every right to challenge this decision because council did not follow due process or perhaps people who may have wanted to oppose the application read the minutes of January 23rd and thought that they could no longer speak against it and didn't turn out on March 18th for the record I will be registering an objection with the minister about the decision made if only for the obvious reason that council refused to consider the issue as serious and to correct their error in the proper manner this is not the only time that council failed to provide it citizen with the high quality municipal services through the effective leadership and legal operating promises that we thought you had promised these types of things are happening too often the council has been democratically elected to run the affairs of the municipality but you do have to follow the written by laws, legislation and the laws that govern you, you cannot just proceed with what's easiest or what's preferred over the last two terms of council there's been a decided effort to prevent public involvement even if it's intended as I am tonight and a positive and advisory manner the steadier roading of public engagement is highly noticeable on your website you say participating council meetings at the last special meeting of council council review I needed to opportunities for the public to participate in council meetings and perhaps he should look again at the website the armistpring field it says is committed to ensuring transparency and encouraging public participation in its governance residents are invited to engage in council meetings by submitting comments on the agenda items or by requesting to appear as a delegation by completing forms below I think council few made reference to asking questions but that's not allowable okay submit your comments in writing it says incidents may provide written comments on specific agenda items schedule for discussion at upcoming council meetings submissions are reviewed and considered as part of the decision making process it's not clear who reviews and considers the applications and from what happened at the last meeting or how council will deal with these submissions at the March 18th meeting I did submit three separate comments and the comments appeared on the agenda they were read at the meeting but they're not shown at all in the minutes and council did not discuss on number of points raised rather the CAO had time to have a serve at a survey of other municipalities to the agenda and revut or dismiss some of the comments is this the way council plan the public interaction to go or is it an administration and administrative process further I'd like to add that the participation process being used has not been adopted I'm almost there got this much left adopted as policy by council nor is it the procedure by law in my opinion it may have been well intended but it misses the mark it is another means of filtering and negating any objection or criticism by the public to administration or council even if it is founded or well intended and this is not being accountable at all my final point that I would say is on the topic of the importance of correct minutes is that they should be carefully reviewed by council before being approved because they serve as a legal record of what actually occurred at a meeting it is also a permanent record of your performance Thank you Any questions from my council? Mark, Councillor Miller Well thank you very much Mayor and Miss Nyland for providing that insight and that information to council I know that you have a keen eye on how we deliberate and how we move forward with certain things and you also share with us tonight the impacts that could have happened in the scenario of that applicant and that would have made us not in a very good or positive light and so as you've heard me say before from day one minutes are a legal document they can be used in court and they really are the historical record of how we deliberate here and I'll continue to uphold that of what you've said Again any organization that I've been in with or be mad Canada and I don't go through all the list but all of them use those documents for historical purposes and to show progress and challenges as well as initiatives and even commitments that were made Our minutes show exactly how we voted so that will be used as an instrument to gauge our performance as you noted performance was the word and so I think that's very helpful. So how do you see us moving forward? I guess my question is how do you recommend we move forward with the minutes or anything that you talked about here just evening? Thank you. I guess my point is not to embarrass council it's just to have due process followed and I don't want to have Springfield have to go to court on things that could be handled in house. Now it was not going to be a major matter because I guess council voted for this proposal but when I started that I didn't know. There's so much ill will between the public and council right now it's hard to come before you and feel that we're even going to be heard even if we have something of importance to tell you and it's not necessarily that we're wanting to like I said embarrass you or point out your flaws or sometimes we have legitimate ideas and our opportunities are being limited more and more and so I guess if you would try and work on improving the opportunities for public and listening to the public when they do come forward is going to be the first start of point of healing maybe. I'd just like to thank you for that Janet. I will consider everything you said. I'll relook at everything and again I'm not here to shut up the residents that's not what I'm here for. I didn't run on that and I still don't not running on that so I will take a look at it for sure. I can again I'm trying to make it in an organized manner for sure. I want respect around here that's the biggest piece that I'm looking for and I will definitely take a look at everything again. So thank you for that. And I don't think I've ever just respected you. No I agree with you but there's been cases where there's been and not you specifically but again things have gone out of control. Well that's you know out of my hands but I mean. I understand that I totally understand that. Yeah this is not specifically to you. It's just like you're not specific you're just being more on the question period and the delegation piece and that's what I'm listening to. Okay so I will take a look at that. Thank you. Okay. Web. So just go to one ear. Can you hear me? Okay. Okay so my name is Pat Burbank of Sunnyside Manitoba. Thank you council for the opportunity to come before you. My topic is participate in a council meeting and audio video tape meetings. I tried to participate in the special meeting of March 28th. I submitted my comments and questions using the form on the municipal website. I received confirmation and I do have a photo by the way calling and Christy I told you I didn't but I found it on my phone. So I did get approval that I had been submitted. It was successful. I'm not blaming anyone. It must go sorry I missed one line. My submission was not received. That's what I was told. So I'm not blaming anyone. It must have been a technical glitch just like this one tonight I guess. So it just shows that process does not always work. Comments must be restricted to what is on the agenda and if you missed the window of opportunity you also lose the momentum of the issue. My comments could be submitted once again once the minutes from that meeting are posted but it won't have the same impact and maybe it wouldn't have had any way. And I just want to say I am. Later on is my opinion but I'm reporting factual things here. So at the meeting, the special meeting on March 28th, the Marmata comment and I'm not picking on anybody. I'm just saying what I heard. The Marmata comment and I'll quote. Let's not get anything wrong here. Today is all about question period short and simple. And of quote. But this meeting was not about question period. The agenda was about public recording of meetings. Now if you look at the agenda about that special meeting on the website, it's been changed. And I don't know that it can be changed unless it's a unanimous decision by council. And I can read that from the part of me the procedure by law about special meetings. At a special meeting, no subjects or matters other than those mentioned in the notice calling the meeting. She'll be taken into consideration unless all members of council are present and the members unanimously agree by resolution to add items to the agenda. So I have both copies. The one I printed Thursday night before the meeting on Friday. And then the one I printed, I think yesterday or today, where two items have been added to that agenda. Don't know why. The mayor said everything was fine. Or two and a half years and now this has become an issue. So I have three questions that I would like answer tonight. The first one is why has it become an issue? And the second is I have noticed March 27th and March 28th. And now again tonight, April 1st, the mayor did not do his housekeeping speech. Why is that? And why was the incorrect sign that was posted at the entrance of the chamber removed? The mayor mentioned scenarios where people would be holding up cell phones in the 43 people would be holding up cell phones in the chamber and recording like it was a rock concert. Very seldom are there 43 people at council meetings. When there are, it's not everyone that wants to record, so don't flatter yourself. In my opinion, the reason this has become an issue for the mayor is there are less and less people in the chamber. After removing question period, there has been only two to five people sitting in the chamber. Now the American focus on what people are doing in the chamber. Before December 17th, there were maybe 10 to 15 people attending meetings. I myself have recorded some parts of the meeting with my cell phone. Not only was I not aware the mayor did not allow this, but also he could not see what everyone was doing in the chamber. The BILA about audio video recording has been working since 2019 maybe longer. Never before February 4th was it an issue for public to audio video record in council meetings. In this day and age, there are cameras and cell phones everywhere. When you were out in public, you best not be picking your nose or scratching your butt because more than likely someone will be recording it. The only thing that has changed in section 1510 of the procedure by law is the amount of time for arrangements to be made by the media. And I've posted the three BILAs here the last one passed on January 15th. And so it shows you it goes that far back. Where it's been the same except for the time of notice. So the results of the Friday special meeting, which to me was a gong show. I don't have that in my notes, but that's just my opinion. Nothing has changed in the BILA 2410. Actually, I'm not sure a BILA can be changed by resolution. I understand it has to be changed by BILA, but I'm not the expert. As the BILA is currently written, it does not restrict the public from expressing their charter protected rights. Again, I thank you. And I hope to get answers to those three questions. Why has this become an issue? I'm not certain. The next one, I've noticed on March 27th and the 28th, the mayor did not do his housekeeping speech. I guess that was. I felt that was under control that point here. I could always bring that back. That's not a problem there. As for the incorrect sign being posted, the entrance chamber removed. I think I was just made aware of that there. It wasn't incorrect. It was actually, I don't see why it would be incorrect. It did specify that the cameras are allowed in the chamber, so under a specific BILA. So we'll find the sign and we'll put it back in there. Oh, are you going to put the same one in? Because it is incorrect. It's up to the administration, whether they want to do that. It's, you know, they mentioned 72 hours, which is incorrect. And it mentions that electronic devices should not be brought. You should refrain from bringing them in here. So that means a lot more than just cell phones. There's a lot of other electronic devices that people have. So, and especially people with hearing aids, a lot of them now are connected to your phone. So like to me, that that is an incorrect sign. It shouldn't be there at period as far as I'm concerned. Okay. Thank you very much, ma'am. Any other questions? Councillor Miller. Thank you, Mayor. And thank you, Mr. Probank, for providing your insight and questions to us tonight. I have that, I have a picture of that sign actually right here. Yeah, I do. I'm sure you do. And I'm going to read it into the record. It says reminder notice, please be advised that. As per procedure by law number 24-10, no audio or video taping of council meetings are permitted without 72 hours prior approval from the chief administrative officer. Please refrain from using electronic devices in the council. And like it's always nice to have these kinds of statements. But actually we have no jurisdiction or right to really restrict the public. And as we've seen from the charter advocates, we should actually be burning these kinds of signs wherever we see them in the public chamber because we want to embrace. We absolutely want to be inclusive. We want the public to know what their elected officials are doing properly or frankly improperly. You know, tonight the Prime Minister is in Winnipeg. And I can assure you there's going to be more than 43 people using their cell phones on him. And it just becomes the reality of public service. You know, not only that, but Pierre Polyev, he was here, I think, on Saturday. He had hundreds of not thousands, thousands of people taping him. He may have said something inappropriate. He may not have, but you know what? It's all taped. If we do the same thing, we should also be accountable. If we say things that are not right or incorrect or inaccurate, we should be held to the highest level to the highest bar, to be accurate and precise. This notice had to be stripped. In fact, thank you, Councillor Cachinsky because you were the one that I saw in an email to the CEO who said, please take that sign down. It's an accurate, inappropriate, and it doesn't meet our own procedure by law. So having said that, it was ripped off that wall or taken down nicely. I don't know, but one way or another, it's not there tonight. Because it cannot uphold itself. There's nothing to say that. Now, again, the mayor or any other member of Council can encourage people not to use their cameras and their recording devices. But really, I think next time around, we have to ensure that any candidate that runs for an elected representative knows that they're getting into the wasps nest. In other words, the public are going to hold that person accountable. All the time from what type of chewing gum they have to the car that they bought and the house that they live in. And so, everything is transparent. Everything is open for, I guess, criticism or accountability. So I guess my question to you is, how do we do things better? Because you know what, I'm said, I'm seated here, and I want to make sure just like Councillor Feewell, I want to make sure, and others, that we do things better, that we don't restrict people and just cause this animosity to continue to build. And so, I think that's exactly what the path we're going down. We need to know from the residents, we need to know from the residents how to do things better. Because I think I've got listening years, and I think hopefully all members of Council here do. Yeah. Well, I feel that, again, question period was a good thing to me, especially when, you know, like filling out that form. It wasn't that hard, but if you're not used to doing stuff on the computer like that and then pressing a button and things disappear. And like I had this sense enough to take a picture of that it was successfully submitted, but I didn't take a picture of what I submitted. So, you know, and why that happened, you know, like technical things, right? That's the day and age we live in. And so, and to submit the delegation, I like when Janet was talking about attachments and stuff like I, I didn't know what went where on that form. So I just figured, well, I'll just hand it in by hand. So when things go goofy like that, like it's nice to have a backup where people can actually come and talk, you know, and not have to be restricted so much. Like I know it has to have structure. I know this, these meetings have to have structure, but it reminds me of the time when the, the gentleman were here from the Lynn Crest airport. And they were speaking and this one fell, like I think they were only given five minutes to speak. I don't know why, but anyway, this one fell, got up and and I could sense he felt rushed like he, you know, I hate to take up your time and. And all this kind of stuff and I, you know, it's it's really sad because that's what you guys are paid for like, you know, It taxpayers come here and like we're doing this out of, you know, because we want to. We want, we want to get answers and and like I'm not trying to be mean to anybody or be rude. I just feel that, you know, things went really wrong in that. Meeting last week and it shouldn't be like that. It should, you know, things got out of control and it should there should be a way of controlling it without anger. So that's pretty much my two cents. Thank you, ma'am. Any other questions? I see none. Thank you very much. Where do we end off? Or 8.1. Okay. Ready to go there, Melinda. Okay. We had gone through quite a few while we're going here. So we're going to start off at 8.1 and then we'll hook up again, whether they'd last part there. That's by law, 25.04 fees and charges a second reading. Can I get a mover in a seconder for 8.1, please? Andy and also a few. Sorry, I just got to find my paper. Okay. Be it resolved that second reading, be given to by law number 2504 being a by law of the arm of springfield to revise and update the fees payable to the arm of springfield for municipal services rendered. And this is a good question for you. We have a question for the CAO. You mentioned an extensive review being done by staff on this. I do have concerns that we do the proper numbers of the costs because we know in the past that the numbers may have been low and that's what again over the years. I have that experience. So I want to make sure the numbers are right. So what I'm more looking for from you is and I hear everything you said to Mrs. Nylin. But the question I do have is is one what timeframe can we expect that report to come out for us? I want to say two months they would have it done. Okay, so it's going to be more in reasonable time not a year from now or six months. Okay, and that's what I'm looking for. Thank you. Councillor Cessky. I would like to find out like we have all those increases on this fees like what percentage we're taking charging people extra on this fees. Because this is like hidden taxation for our residents and maybe not everybody's aware. We're going to work on our budget and you know we have to know what percentage are taxes going to be increased through assessment. And then whatever council going to decide what we're going to do with the increasing taxes above that. So we have to know because this is going to be part of our tax structure for residents in this municipality. So I can't say there's a percentage on each. We do a review of the surrounding RMs and we get kind of an average. And then we decide whether we think it's appropriate or not. We're not trying to make money. We're just trying to cover costs. So we'll do kind of our own review to see who's doing it. How long it takes it and make sure it's cost recoverable. So we're not trying to make a profit. A lot of them are set by regulation like lottery license. We can't go over 1% of value. So those that are legislated. We make sure that we're following that. So we have a lot of them already set in bylaws that we follow. And I think the biggest. Comparable that we do is the planning department fees. So we look at all this arounding districts and RMs like planning districts see what they're charging for structures and. And again, making sure it seems reasonable. So if you make that statement that means that. We didn't recover our cost previously or we just taking numbers from some other municipalities that and and how do we know that we recovering our costs or just putting the number there because other municipalities are charging that doesn't make any sense. We look at wage increases because there's hourly fees that staff. So we make sure that our wage increases are covered also parts. So a lot of the water and waste. If they have to purchase a meter and that's covered if those costs went up and we're making sure that we're not subsidizing the cost for that meter for instance. So. And this is not just picking numbers out of the air. We do this is taken as probably eight months to do the review to bring this to council. And I see some of the charges going like 100% increase. So how we this possible wages didn't win up 100% or cost over employees. But we increasing these charges or fees. Minor innovation from $100 to $200 major innovation from 200 to 400. And I think that's the problem setting a three year schedule. So that's why we went to one year so that we can do a further review after the years over, especially with everything that's going on with. Supply and demand and we don't know what the cost will be. So we didn't want to lock ourselves in to too many schedules. Thank you. Councillor Miller. Thank you, Mayor. I kind of echo and share the same mindset as Council or fuel and I think it would be an addition and helpful for us to see what your recommendations will be whether it be as you say in approximately two months or so. Having said that I also echo what Miss Nile and said that our capital heavy and our capital capital sewer levies may be low. We don't want to head into an infrastructure deficit. As you all will remember a couple years ago the city when a pig was going to charge something like 45 50 thousand dollars per lot. Because they actually realized that that's what it costs and then they had push back there was the minute well I maybe shouldn't cope but there was a lobbyist or their group of lobbyist home builders who said, you know, this just doesn't seem reasonable. And you're going to stymie us you're going to stymie growth in in what a pig but the older reality is why should the taxpayer take on the burden of doing infrastructure I just don't get it you know there's everything from a course street lighting to. recycling bins street cleaning and on and on it goes and if you nickel and diamond. We aren't we are subsidizing the tax rate pair is subsidizing new development that is not a new thing. And I'm going to say it once again when I was in the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Wandapeg we looked at this thoroughly and it has been historically that way. I think that's the way that we are going to be doing this through Canada that municipalities subsidize infrastructure for developers because. The RM's the council's feel that if you have more population more people are paying taxes but the reality is it's it's not that way it's a it's a slinky I guess. And I'm not going to do a speech here but the reality is I would absolutely be in favor of increasing new development fees capital water and capital sewer not because I'm a nasty guy but because I don't want the taxpayers to pay for it and I'm a taxpayer too so I don't want my my family and and your family to. Beyond the backs of home builders who are yielding. Actually quite a good significant profit from developing here and has not to discourage them it's to get our fair share as rate pairs who exist here we're the ones who live here why should we why should we subsidizing others going forward. I don't think it's as negative as one would have as a context people are still going to build in city going to take whether their lot ladies are 45,000 or 25 it still happens it's not going to it's not going to cause the push back that that the lobbyist the lobbyist the home builder say it's going to do it's it's a proven fact so that's my concern thank you. I just have a few comments there the. This is dark and has been worked on for the believers he also said eight months we've reviewed it there cost are going up and I think it's a very good judgment there that we're not doing this every three years because. I think I mentioned a greatest tonight they've gone up 40% I believe in the last two years we're playing close to seven or a thousand for graders and everything else is going up there wages and everything that follows with that so we have to remain competitive as well. We don't want to be putting ourselves out of the market there we have to compete with Tashay developers there and. So that we're remaining attractive for people come in here to invest and they are investing hard so increase in the the capitals have to be incremental competitive slots in increments so there. So how to finish that off with that if we can read the resolution then we can vote on it. Be it is all that second reading given to buy one number twenty five four being a buy love the arm a spring field to revise and update the fees payable to the arm a spring field for municipal services rendered. Those in support of by the twenty five or four fees and charges second reading show pants. Those in support is councilor Warren deputy mayor fuel and the mayor terran those opposed counselors of Miller and Kizinski so passed. And then if we can get to eight point one one that's a buy love twenty five or four fees and charges third reading kind of going to move on a second or for that to please. The bit mayor fuel and terran. Be resolved that third and final reading be given to buy one number twenty five or four being a buy love the arm a spring field to revise and update the fees payable to the arm a spring field for municipal services rendered. And I'm just going to add to this that again I think we're undercutting ourselves in that we're not taking into account the other infrastructure the new fire trucks the new. You know, rec center the new whatever right I mean these are ongoing costs that. Our community broadly could share but it really should be the new new individuals who are coming to this community who. Have to pay their fair share that we're not subsidizing I almost assure you that if we do it analysis if you do in analysis because the university's approved proven this if you do in analysis it's an infrastructure deficit and we're putting ourselves in that and I don't support that. I'll see any other questions then if we can to the reading there we can vote. Our that's already been read so if I get a show hands those are support of a point one that's by law twenty four or four fees and charges third reading show hands those support. The council are worn the W Ameriffuel and Terran those opposed the council is a Miller and Cousinsky this whole past. And where did we end off further. Uh, I at nine point one. So nine point one is action items from the March 18th council meetings so there was a few questions that council asks us to follow up on. The police report provided for the February report and there was a question about municipal by law offenses and I had missed it at the time but. If you look back at the report it's the second page the last line it showed one municipal by law offense in the February report and you'll see I think it's one again in this this month's report as well. And so I think that's the question for the total cost paid to the WMR which was also known as mayors and reason of the capital region then it changed to partnership of the man with the capital region. Now known as Winnipeg Metropolitan region we've been a member since 1998. And the two of us are records were unknown from 2000 up to 2001 and I'm not sure if it's because I didn't charge at the beginning years or we would have had to go on to the paper copies. But over the 24 years there's been a total paid of 133,76810. And so I was just to check numbers that you asked me to follow up one check 162284 exile of Canada so that was for water and waste parts that were purchased and check 162277 for sterons limited that's a new contractor doing grading work for us. I want to ask you a question about how other RM's deal with FCM conference attendance for council I put it out to the MMA network I only received two responses both provided a policy in that regard. The RM had been Donald the head of council and two members of council attend FCM each year and the arm of hand over all council members and the CAO attend FCM annually. Thank you very much actually kind of going to move on to second earth for that before we are not for a resolution so information. All right, Councillor Miller. Thank you, Mayor. And thank you calling for getting that information. It's very useful because this is something that we all wanted to know so our participation in the WMR or its preceding. Being was for 24 years and at a cost of 133,76810 plus of course, prettyems and or other mileage that participants had right am I correct on that. Yeah, I didn't calculate that amount but no so I would assume there's some additional charges yes. So do you see that and I'm not sure who's there's somebody in this room who could perhaps answer this but of that 134,000 dollars minimum that we've invested. What have what has it yielded us in the words how we gain anything over 24 years being in the WMR its predecessors. Firstly, I've seen the benefits through some different tendering opportunities, especially through the fire department where they've worked together in bulk purchases for gloves and safety. And that kind of thing. The other benefit through the fire is where part of this reporting system that were required to do through the commissioners fire commissioners office. Our membership is 3500 per year and as a non member, I think it's $6,000 so that's that was kind of when WMR and John Q were part of the same thing. And Q separated we stayed with that so we get a reduced rate for some of those software programs so administratively we see benefits. Council that you'll have to. Yep and I can finish off and that there being at the table there is far better than not being at the table. You want to be at the table that to at least make the changes on the contiguousness of the the Winnipeg Metropolitan Region there. This is still in the works there and unfortunately 133,000 is a lot of money you know over 30 years there. It's an initiative brought on by a mayor Susan Thompson there and it's been continued through and until myself there. We do accomplish lots at the meetings there. It's not just things have some people say just warming up a seat there. It's more than that. There's a discussion is going on there and as we know plan 25 is been shelved and there's a new plan that's been poured forward under bill four. Bill 37 is under review. It's going to be discussed in the legislative building legislative building. I would hope sooner than later but it's anybody speculation when that's actually going to be done and once it's ratified. Bill four then we could be able to see what the changes are for that but the changes may be quite in depth though. They may not be much it's all speculation so at this point here we have to wait and see whether legislative electoral people have done and their debates and then there'll be community consultations there scheduled. Once this is all done so let's a process and it works. I don't have any mayor few. Yeah I just like to speak to too. I believe out of the 12 or the 10 years that I've been on council it also has been legislated so I don't think there's been an option for us to opt out. I can tell you this though I was at the planning conference and minister Glen Samard was there and spoke and it basically went against through the process. I'm stating that the bill for it will be debated on the floor also there will be a public or there will be public open houses and that they will come back then to be passed and legislated in October is the timeframe that he. Again approximately set October so I just wanted to share that with everybody too. Thank you. And I can I'll get to and matter. But we're we're in a process every month we're meeting we may increase our meetings to eight hours as opposed to just a three so get all the mayors and reeds together it's hard to find a date that's always suitable so we may be increasing the hours there we're always having the consultation that the minister has spoke with us. The province is very highly invested in the in the the plan the regional plan going forward and we're in fact meeting with the deputy minister think on the April the 17th or 20th I'm not sure when. I hope that answered your question. Councilor Gessin. Thank you Mr. Mayer. So you're saying that. This report was presented from WMR plant on a 50 it took five years to prepare and now you're going to have like one year to do it. How you're going to do it and you're going to revive the plant on a 50 again and and makes small changes and nobody's saying here that they're going to be public hearings on on on this new proposed. Plan so how that going to work on the presentation so you're just going to have couple more than and people go look and you know couple people and they're have to be public hearing and Mr. Mayer you have to stress out the without public hearing that thing not going to go forward I mean not going to agree to it. We have to have people involved in that we cannot have he asked like what happened with plant one and 50 because it didn't work and don't please don't re hash and I want to ask you one question like you said that you want to make changes to plant one and 50 and one of the item you said. So you're talking about high density what do you mean by that so you mean that you want a higher density in our community or or you want to don't have high density in our community because you never. Stay that to the community out what we're going to do with this what you're proposing on a new plan. First of all the public hearings will be part of it there but just you can't have public hearings until you know what the plan is going to be and whether. What bill four comes up with there I think the the premier called of the freedom bill it's in fact it's amendments to the. To the when to pay charter as well as the planning act so we don't know what those changes are going to be so the public hearings will be coming of course that's always going to be the case. The you mentioned about it wasn't continued to in never bill was just the it wasn't safe to to proceed there and as for the high density there I think I'm not sure what contacts. I don't like to be told our our RRM what our densies are our to be our autonomy should be protected the. I'm very much so for that my hat is with the the arm is sprinkled my secondary hat is with the the WMR my oath is to the WMR and I'll always consider the interest of my. Our RRM sprinkled the first density is is one of those can very contentious issues and we're we're studying it there the report 25 to the shelf that's it's not anymore so that's all I can say. How can you proceed and do this new plan we don't need I don't know when bill for going to be introduced so you might go to have only one year how can you do so much work you was working for five years on the previous plan to on the 50 and now you're going to do everything in one year. And next year the election coming so we have to really you know make sure that we have everything. Before presented to us so we can see if we go to participate in this new plan or not. Yes I totally agree with you there and it's going it's we've been working hard on this. Meeting every month since it was a shelf so that's all I can really tell you is that we're working hard at that we got consultants coming in there to find that that that balance of what we want and fortunate we couldn't hear what the public wanted and never built. There but we did have the consultations in July and we've had other consultations around the city. All that stuff has not been thrown to the waste there all that is being considered it's in a data base there so we're evaluating what the those comments that were and on top of that we will be evaluating the net at the public hearings as well. Thank you. Any other questions at all. I see none then we can. We're going to. And we'll proceed to sorry 11.5 that's a mount up association of municipal emergency coordinators conference. Is there any red that. I think it's when we're talking about here. I think there'd be a darn good one to go to. And we're going to want to ready and it's it's a good event in good conference to go to. Dominion mover secretary of that. If I can get a mover in a second or four that then we can have a vote with regards to that 11.5 man to the association municipal. The vertices. When in NEMALinda. And get in the name of this. So that's the way to say that all of council be delegated to attend the man to this association of municipal emergency coordinators conference June 17th. 2025 and when to pay get their discretion questions from council to all for their to that council. Thank you Mayor. Just a question is what is the cost what is the registration cost per. And that's always going to be something that our, well, we haven't got an emergency coordinator anymore. We're looking for that, but think Brock is taking over that spot. So we'll always have a specialist involved in something like that. But with that thread, can I get him show of hands those and support? There's unanimous in this carried. Then we'll go to 11.6. That's the appointment of an additional tax sale manager, 1302. Can I get him over in a second or for 11.6. Glenn and Melinda. Be a result of that pursuant to buy law number 1302 of the armist Springfield tax servicing. Be appointed to manage property tax eras recovery for the armist Springfield. Be a further result that pursuant to buy law number 1302 of the armist Springfield. The following individuals be appointed tax sale managers for the armist Springfield. Donna Zincue, Vice President of Tax Service, or Tyler Burnside, associate of tax servicing. With that red and questions for council. W. Mary of View. Yeah, I have a question for the CEO. Are those costs recovery for any of those for the tax sellers? I just cost outright. That's recovered through each property owner. Okay. Thank you. Councillor Miller. Thank you, Mayor. So I think this builds on councilor fuels question. But what is the financial impact to our municipality to hire this additional person or tax? There's no impact to the RM we pay upfront, but then we recover through the property. Thank you. I don't see any other questions. I think that's the question. If we can get a show hands, those in support of 11.6, appointment of an additional tax sale manager, those in support. The unanimous. Any do you have your hand up there? Yes. So it's unanimous in this carried. Then we'll go to 11.7, that's a development agreement, a condition of subdivision under our long amount of limited number. Move on a second for that, please. Thank you. I'm a member of the Debtimary fuel and Councillor Ruan.

We're close at nine 15.", "summary": "**Part 1 Summary:**\n Thank you very much. March 18th. And so I want to make sure that our municipality, if we are monitoring arsenic in our water that is disclosed and it's known to the residents, Health Canada actually also encourages everyone that has a well to test the arsenic in their water. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 2 Summary:**\nSo I'm hopeful that in once the new draft guidelines or the guidelines come into effect on a national level, perhaps the provinces or the health agencies of each province will support those who are on well water because we want to protect citizens. Usually if I was on Zoom I would say Zoom but I'll have to confirm whether that was or not. Fire it seems it's getting slower there for this report here but that's only going to pick up with the weather starts getting warmer and becoming drier and grass grass fires are going to be out there. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 3 Summary:**\nPublic works in our work and group discussions the topic of One purpose use age was discussed that's reference equipment there with the director Amoffit the vehicles are equipment now that we we buy we try to you know I'm going to speak on behalf of the director of the plane there they have to be more resilient and have a dual purpose there the days of just having one function there obviously that's going to be the case there but if we can utilize the function out being a couple ways three ways or wherever it is so that's that's what we're looking for because costs repairs and maintenance are extremely high. I'm sorry just questions and I see none they're going to get a show hands those are supportive of the consent agenda as unanimous and it is carried. Here is all the council of the arm a springfield approved the reduction on speed along the Signington road between the perimeter highway 101 and Naven Road to be posted at 70 kilometers an hour. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 4 Summary:**\nCouncil felt that 90 was a little bit too fast even though most people were doing under 90 and in fact they're doing around in the 70s there for the most part there's one area where they're actually doing 81 but that was a very brief area I like to say what it was but I don't remember but reducing it to a 70 is an appropriate speed in my mind to hear there's a few roads like that so this is nice that we've actually approached this and I want to mention the name of our the lady who brought this forward there if I remember it I say it but I didn't get permission to say it in any case there so I think it's a it's a good safety measure within the arm or springfield introduced at the 70 kilometers an hour so with that you have to read a resolution but I didn't kind of just go to show hands for 11.1 simultaneously rolled speed reduction that is unanimous and is carried then if we can go to 11.2 that's 25 a springfield public library level mover and a secular Patrick and Glenn we resolve that council approved the 2025 springfield public library level and the amount of 155254 dollars any questions from council with regards to 11.2 springfield level I see none I got to show hands of those in support of 11.2 as unanimous and is so carried I think we still have time for 11.3 that's a water appropriations we got to 1 2 3 4 5 items on here actually 4 but there's 5 down here 5 oh oh I'm sorry yeah I was in it okay can I get a show of hand or a a mover and a second for water

Kirk at their discretion I guess I'm on the record I'm not a golfer there but I think it's a good initiative there this is the first year I believe as well so I was support in total of 750 their contribution there let's guess that's for the lunch sponsorship label there and it gives us all the our logo is out on the the course and so on like that it's all the fine down there so I'm willing to give 125 I guess myself gonna so Warren yeah yes yeah oh as come in the council is gonna attend that golf tournament I'm not I am not I'm probably not gonna golf but I think I'll go there just to to mingle a little bit oh I'll climb your moves to get I'm just kind of looking for you know I get the lunch sponsor but you know it's also $500 to me is a pretty good deal also you have corporate signage by every T so there's 18 times that you're seeing our sponsorship where lunch you're only seeing it once per table so I think we would get more out of it with a signage by T just again for notoriety of the arm a springfield and being a multi event you know it's hopefully will track some business here and that will look at springfield for business you give it that too so I'll amend mine to $100 and the other councils I'd give a hundred yeah I'll give a hundred too council or kizinski in emerald well I won't be attending so I don't know if I should contribute you have to it so it's I know our signage gonna be there but what do we gonna achieve by that are we gonna draw on business or what are you gonna be just being visible that's about it being visible and there's gonna be multiple businesses there for sure I would think golfing being that it's done by the chamber and it's there's gonna be multiple chamber there bozier, silker, and ourselves so I believe you know again it's a good cause for that reason I don't want to speak on behalf of myself so yeah well I want to be contribute yeah I'm gonna pass on this but I wish councilor fuel a hole in one yeah I'm so waiting for that one all right let's just have a hearing if he gets a hole one then we're gonna readjust this okay so councilors warn fuel in myself a hundred dollars each okay so just to clarify the resolution was read that the it was all that all of council be delegated to attend the all four local golf tournament being held June 19th and silker get their discretion so if I could just confirm that the mover councilor warn and secondary councilor Terran can amend this resolution to include and be it for the result that council provide a five hundred dollars towards a whole sponsorship so yeah I thought it was for sponsorship as well they had the categories one are the the 250 550 on the right there so this is just for attending their then I don't know of the asking for money as well well councilor saved an invite to attend and then there's also the sponsorship opportunities so you have the option to do either or both then with that clarify there I don't think that changes in what is mind and will 300 dollars will go towards that so just providing 300 dollars to the yeah and the different levels I haven't got it on here is a 500 dollars is the the lowest 500 250,000, 750 and 150 okay then I'll put in 300 dollars to make it a 500 dollar one there okay for boxes there or whatever they call those things I may change remind I may start getting into golf a little bit more but I find it a very frustrating game with the hockey stick yeah but I'm a goalie I take Pax and a head a so that's which is Dumber I think we can go to could I get a vote with regards to item 11.4 all four local golf tournament that would be councilor Warren fuel and the terran those opposed that would be councilor's Miller and Kazinsky so passed I think we three minutes early I think and I know everybody is here we can go to delegations there Mrs. \n\n**Part 5 Summary:**\nLaLonda you are ready even three minutes early turn along oh bank I like to thank you for the opportunity to speak on by law 13 or two for the business launch sort of sort of interruption there have we have started your time there but it's a ten minutes for your your delegation there and we'll give you will give you a warning a two minutes or something Kristi will tell you that but no worries I won't need it I don't think okay sorry about that okay so I'm not the one of the opportunities to speak on by law 13 dash zero two additional sales manager tax sales manager I don't see a need for another employee to address this issue since there's so cute tax sales the CEO and administration usually used to handle this also I haven't been on council for a while but if my memory serves people correctly I don't think a by law can be changed by a resolution in my my 12 years on council there were any tax sales residents came in it's a last minute to pay or in rare cases they were granted a payment method given to them for extra time to to make the payments so I'm just are we expecting that the huge property assessment increases to lead because of more for closures in the past large increases in assessments recounted by little by just decreasing the the mill rate and sunrise school division has recently done not to help out the citizens my question is is this something that council would consider the first question man is the foreclosures do we expect more foreclosures that was your question I was wondering if that's why we're getting another employee which we either still we need because you're expecting more for closures because of the increased assessment I think those three questions I'll refer to for a CEO okay so just to clarify we're not amending the by law the by law was just attached for information so it's a resolution just appointing an additional tax sales managers name from tax service to run the tax sale process for the armistring field we've been using tax service since 2013 to do that typically we start with about 400 properties that are in tax sale every year that windows down to about 50 and by the time the tax sale date actually comes about we I don't think we've had too many I think this year we had two properties in tax sale but there is quite a detailed process so it's not something that staff can take on any longer because of the amount of work that's required and the details to meet all the deadlines and all the filings that are required so we typically have the same amount of properties that go into tax sale and the same that end up actually at the tax sale date so are there more regulations now to do the paper work and there were in 2013 no but we've been using tax service since 2013 every year for the tax sale process of about 2012 that but that's changed my question I guess I think there was issues when the RM was doing it that we weren't able to complete that required information and meet all the deadlines just because it's it's basically a full-time job okay okay and well I guess my one question that I wanted to answer and I don't know if the mayor wants to address that or or everybody but was the but that does decreasing the mill rate to make it more reasonable for citizens since we have said to large assessment increase that's something we'll have to discuss with council certainly not going to be able to give it an answer on that no I just want to if you would consider it I think we're always looking to consider the lower taxes and lower the mill rates I think that's that goes without saying whether it's achievable that's a little after the term in that well it's been done other times and you know when there's been a huge impact on our residents so I just thought of be something to look at again thank you very much ma'am thank you thank you then we can go to item 7.2 that'll be Mrs. \n\n**Part 6 Summary:**\nNylon you say your name and your address please I'm Jonathan O'Bank good evening I am going to explain to you that I am not sick I have a chronic cough I'm trying to control it with the cough candy and I have water here but there's no germs as my point you know so I'd like to make a presentation on the proposed second reading to buy law number 254 the fee in charges by law usually the public doesn't get too concerned about this typical bylaw but I think it's important that council consider some of the ramifications and implications of some of the proposed changes to the existing fee in charges bylaw my intention is simply to provide a constructive perspective on a few points in the bylaw and it's hope that council keeps an open mind and considers the argument and not simply dismiss it I don't know how much council has discussed these changes in the working group meeting but at the first reading there was no discussion before the public and I'm not sure if you understand that there could be some negative consequences by passing the proposed bylaw as written my first point is that council is proposing a significant tax change from the previous bylaw number 2114 in that bylaw there were three schedules A, B and C that applied to specified years and show sliding creases to some permit licenses or levies and this proposed bylaw there's only one schedule that will apply to 2025 but on point three it also allows council from time to time by resolution to amend the schedule I think that this changes less effective and unclear as council considered that the fees and charges bylaw is posted on the website and maybe one of the most viewed bylaws by residents wanting to know the cost of projects like resolutions that may change fees may not be clearly published and are usually only for a minor change not a complete schedule change I would suggest that council reconsider and return to the format set out in bylaw 2114 and have three schedules and a three year graded rate increase my second point is that council is removing the animal control section from this bylaw but does not propose another bylaw yet to replace it there will be no authority in place until such a new bylaw is adopted I would suggest that council holds off at least third reading until an animal licensing bylaw is in place the third point relates to the capital levies charges to new development it's on page nine of your bylaw it's rare for me to be promoting higher fees but I feel for the capital water levie in the capital sewer levie that council reconsider the slight increase to these two areas at the last council meeting I did submit some comments about this and the CAO then attached to the agenda and compared and review with nine other municipalities that are in the capital region it shows higher fees for just just wait a sec we lost either yeah I would go back just a little bit no still don't hear I believe you uh you you you you you interesting you you you you you you you you you can you hear me now okay so assuming that's not part of my 10 minutes you I'm going to go back to at the last council meeting I did submit some comments about this in the CO then attached to the agenda a comparative review with nine other municipalities that are in the capital region it shows higher fees for e-saint Paul McDonald and headingly and the others appears slightly lower that my concern about this comparison is that it does not compare apples with apples St. \n\n**Part 7 Summary:**\nClements and West Saint Paul for example don't have a sewer livy we don't know why but perhaps it's because there's another method of funding wastewater disposal given that council is proposing significant investment and borrowing infrastructure for the dows and the regional lagoon I would suggest that the measuring the measuring stick that you use to set these rates is different historically speaking the levees applied to new development were in part to cover some of the costs of existing infrastructure that's like buying into the infrastructure that existing tax payers have funded and also contributing towards future upgrades and expansion that the new development for the most part creates up to now upgrades have only been in the low millions of dollars but now they're going to cost multiples of tens of millions of dollars it doesn't seem fair or even reasonable that everyone currently living in Springfield will have to pay for these infrastructure upgrades that are due to new development and that new development isn't footing a larger share of the bill I think it was that Stanteck did a review of rates a few years ago and I would suggest that they are another company be hired to determine what an appropriate levy would be instead of just increasing the existing rate by a few dollars My last point is on the record search fee and I think my comments that the last meeting were unclear maybe even incorrect there is no change to the rates from the previous bylaw but I'm worried that the general office record search is not clearly defined some records are required to be accessible to the public by statute or regulation so hourly fee excuse me should be applied to them other than copying of course other records may be accessible by policy of council and I will admit that the general office usually has applied me with copies of minutes and bylaws without any hourly fee but as written this charge is not clear perhaps a clear policy as suggested by the province about which records are accessible and when fees would apply could clear up any misinterpretation that's my first presentation Thank you I can talk to the director with regards to the fees and the CEO can take the rest of the questions there I think he says on what dog bylaw fees I'll talk to the IR fees so we have to weigh out the fees there to so that we're competitive with other RMs there so the increments are relatively small so that's the main reason behind that I would think that we're always in the competition with TASHA and developers there so our levies are I think well within that bounce and all the current to our CEO for the next few questions Could I respond to your comments? Sure I guess you missed my point because you did a survey and you're sort of in the middle already so we're still being competitive but we are also doing we're charging other levies on other things that other municipalities aren't for streetlights and streets and different things if our main focus should be on our sewer and water that's where the levies should be I just want the new development to pay a share of what the tax payer is going to have to fund and if it's like I don't think your argument of being competitive is substantiated by the documents you gave me or that you showed Thank you Your other questions in RCO can look at that So you mentioned animal control so I just want to let you know that we do have an animal control by law 1803 that sets out those fines as well we've include that in by law 1918 which is our main soapil by law enforcement act by law and that has the fines there as well so the fines are set and we go through those by laws to issue them so this one is setting the license fees for animals and they're not in those other by laws they are in those by laws as well the license fees correct you said fines I'm sorry sorry yeah license and fines are all in both of those by law so they're covered elsewhere thank you Development levies so actually there's a quite extensive review being done by internal staff now the recommendation was to keep the levies the same I felt that we needed to keep increasing by little bit so that it wasn't just a huge increase so it was my decision to increase what we did just so that when they come back with accurate numbers for the increase it's not such a hit at once so we are planning that's why we did one schedule this year so that we can come back with those fees that whole comparable document for council to review and then we can set new fees for 26 and going forward I appreciate what you're saying except that rate you're increasing is not going to be the amount that attacks payer is going to pay for the dow's borrowing levy for example it was just a subjective number you used yeah so the number we used was based on the projects and population and there's a whole formula and I can't even pretend to understand it that would have to be our staff that come and review that but right now we have not approved developments that are looking into the new water system yet so currently we're still using the current capacity so we felt comfortable charging the current rates so those developments that are still using current capacity so we're at that brain canal that we're saying no more until the new fees are set and we have that comparison done so then two comments one of the fifty dollars or what you that was not just a random number the fifty dollars the increase that you're proposing for the levy for the water well our plan was to increase it by five hundred dollars each year but they those are doing the review said we shouldn't increase now right now and I wasn't comfortable not putting any increase at all okay and the last point is what you propose about resolutions amending this is that just in there for this one year and then you'll read through all the rates again so typically we have that condition in there so that if there is rates that come up and we don't have it in there we can add those by resolution but typically we're not going to be amending rates that are currently in there until we do a new complete schedule okay thank you just a comment this is awful can I can hear the echo that was joke I didn't hear it no I just sort of oh he was bored can I start with the second one now sure okay now I did time this at home I if I don't get interruptions and I don't offer something I will be under ten minutes so I'll go while I'm still doing okay the arm is good evening I'd like to start with a few reminders for council the arm is Springfield mission statement for example the arm provides high quality municipal services to our community through effective leadership and safe sustainable operating practices you're guiding principles state behaviors and actions be exemplified by government administration community members of Springfield accountability transparency fairness and integrity lead by example safety public service and teamwork in the 2022 council members guide the document provided to all council members when they were elected and it was produced by the province says that municipalities are mature governments which are democratically accountable to their citizens and responsible for delivering public services it goes on to say that minutes council minutes are the official public record of council's decisions and are normally taken by your CIO minutes must be made available to the public in a timely fashion and are typically posted on the municipal websites minutes do not include statements are debate and they are a record of decisions only I remind you of these points because council actions seem to be forgetting the rules and being accountable at times I'm speaking about the last planning meeting held on March 18 where you chose to proceed with a public hearing even after the matter of the minutes of the January 23 meeting which had been adopted by council on February 27 indicated that the public representation had been closed you did not consider the minutes as important the CIO even stated that minutes are not a legal document and not verbatim she advised council to proceed with the second public hearing because it had been advertised not only were the minutes of January 23 and air so as the CIO's advice I've attached for you or it was on the agenda a copy of the federal provincial territorial initiative document called Growing Forward 2 it's found on the web it states that under the corporations act minutes are a legal requirement for all organizations registered as a corporation to keep accurate meeting minutes board approved meeting minutes serve as a legal record of what actually occurred at a meeting and they are admissible as evidence in court they show evidence that the board actions were according to proper procedure outlined in the organizations by law when I registered online to be a delegation tonight or a delegate tonight I found out that I could only attach one document to the form so I also found on the provincial province of Manor Tobbe website a forms portal appendix d talking about regular minutes with a Q&A I have copies for council but I would like to read out a few excerpts question what are the Robert's rules for a meeting minutes Robert's rules section 48 one dash 16 state that the minutes should contain mainly a record of what was done at the meeting not what was said by the members minutes are not transcript of meetings rather the document contains a record of actions taken by the body organized by the meetings order of business agenda next question what are minutes in government minutes are the written record of all actions in a meeting including city council meetings meetings held by any government agency or any committee of the government agency that require minutes to ensure that these agencies or committees follow the law next question to meeting minutes need to be approved yes as the organization must approve minutes of what happened at the last meeting the meeting minutes are the only the approved version of meeting minutes is considered a legal record next question do meeting minutes have to be verbatim word for word accounts meeting minutes should not be verbatim the goal isn't to recount every director everything director said exactly as they said it but to give a clear overview of what the issue was what points were raised and what more decided when they decided question what happens if you disagree with the minutes of a meeting if any changes are corrections are offered to the minutes a motion must be made seconded and passed with a vote they must provide the exact wording for their suggestion if a member does not approve of the proposed correction they can make a motion to amend the minutes with an alternative correction last question is can meeting minutes be changed after approval board members are meeting participants may suggest or request amendments to meeting minutes at any time meeting minutes may be amended before or after the minutes have been formally adopted perhaps this does not seem to be important information to council but I can assure you it is important to me and a number of other taxpayers who expect council to behave in the exemplified manner to be accountable transparent and follow the democratic the past laws I have checked the audio and of January 23rd and the minutes were incorrect the chair did not close the evidentiary portion of the meeting has recorded but council approved the minutes and until they are legally changed minutes they are the legal record and would be a missible admissible in court I might remind you that this was not just any meeting it was a public hearing about a development plan amendment that now has to receive ministerial approval before third reading council should not have just ignored the issue of the erroneous minutes you should have taken the proper steps to correct the erroneous minutes and do it before moving forward no matter how much you wanted the issue to move on or go away the minutes of January 23rd as they stand are the legal record until council goes through the process to change them imagine what would have happened if council had voted to deny the amendment the applicant would have had every right to challenge this decision because council did not follow due process or perhaps people who may have wanted to oppose the application read the minutes of January 23rd and thought that they could no longer speak against it and didn't turn out on March 18th for the record I will be registering an objection with the minister about the decision made if only for the obvious reason that council refused to consider the issue as serious and to correct their error in the proper manner this is not the only time that council failed to provide it citizen with the high quality municipal services through the effective leadership and legal operating promises that we thought you had promised these types of things are happening too often the council has been democratically elected to run the affairs of the municipality but you do have to follow the written by laws, legislation and the laws that govern you, you cannot just proceed with what's easiest or what's preferred over the last two terms of council there's been a decided effort to prevent public involvement even if it's intended as I am tonight and a positive and advisory manner the steadier roading of public engagement is highly noticeable on your website you say participating council meetings at the last special meeting of council council review I needed to opportunities for the public to participate in council meetings and perhaps he should look again at the website the armistpring field it says is committed to ensuring transparency and encouraging public participation in its governance residents are invited to engage in council meetings by submitting comments on the agenda items or by requesting to appear as a delegation by completing forms below I think council few made reference to asking questions but that's not allowable okay submit your comments in writing it says incidents may provide written comments on specific agenda items schedule for discussion at upcoming council meetings submissions are reviewed and considered as part of the decision making process it's not clear who reviews and considers the applications and from what happened at the last meeting or how council will deal with these submissions at the March 18th meeting I did submit three separate comments and the comments appeared on the agenda they were read at the meeting but they're not shown at all in the minutes and council did not discuss on number of points raised rather the CAO had time to have a serve at a survey of other municipalities to the agenda and revut or dismiss some of the comments is this the way council plan the public interaction to go or is it an administration and administrative process further I'd like to add that the participation process being used has not been adopted I'm almost there got this much left adopted as policy by council nor is it the procedure by law in my opinion it may have been well intended but it misses the mark it is another means of filtering and negating any objection or criticism by the public to administration or council even if it is founded or well intended and this is not being accountable at all my final point that I would say is on the topic of the importance of correct minutes is that they should be carefully reviewed by council before being approved because they serve as a legal record of what actually occurred at a meeting it is also a permanent record of your performance Thank you Any questions from my council? Mark, Councillor Miller Well thank you very much Mayor and Miss Nyland for providing that insight and that information to council I know that you have a keen eye on how we deliberate and how we move forward with certain things and you also share with us tonight the impacts that could have happened in the scenario of that applicant and that would have made us not in a very good or positive light and so as you've heard me say before from day one minutes are a legal document they can be used in court and they really are the historical record of how we deliberate here and I'll continue to uphold that of what you've said Again any organization that I've been in with or be mad Canada and I don't go through all the list but all of them use those documents for historical purposes and to show progress and challenges as well as initiatives and even commitments that were made Our minutes show exactly how we voted so that will be used as an instrument to gauge our performance as you noted performance was the word and so I think that's very helpful. \n\n**Part 8 Summary:**\nSo how do you see us moving forward? I guess my question is how do you recommend we move forward with the minutes or anything that you talked about here just evening? Thank you. I submitted my comments and questions using the form on the municipal website. And I don't know that it can be changed unless it's a unanimous decision by council. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 9 Summary:**\nAt a special meeting, no subjects or matters other than those mentioned in the notice calling the meeting. So the results of the Friday special meeting, which to me was a gong show. So that means a lot more than just cell phones. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 10 Summary:**\nSo, and especially people with hearing aids, a lot of them now are connected to your phone. He may have said something inappropriate. And like I had this sense enough to take a picture of that it was successfully submitted, but I didn't take a picture of what I submitted. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 11 Summary:**\nAnd so, and to submit the delegation, I like when Janet was talking about attachments and stuff like I, I didn't know what went where on that form. I do have concerns that we do the proper numbers of the costs because we know in the past that the numbers may have been low and that's what again over the years. So we have a lot of them already set in bylaws that we follow. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 12 Summary:**\nComparable that we do is the planning department fees. So we didn't want to lock ourselves in to too many schedules. Beyond the backs of home builders who are yielding. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 13 Summary:**\nI don't think it's as negative as one would have as a context people are still going to build in city going to take whether their lot ladies are 45,000 or 25 it still happens it's not going to it's not going to cause the push back that that the lobbyist the lobbyist the home builder say it's going to do it's it's a proven fact so that's my concern thank you. And I'm just going to add to this that again I think we're undercutting ourselves in that we're not taking into account the other infrastructure the new fire trucks the new. If you look back at the report it's the second page the last line it showed one municipal by law offense in the February report and you'll see I think it's one again in this this month's report as well. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 14 Summary:**\nNow known as Winnipeg Metropolitan region we've been a member since 1998. And Q separated we stayed with that so we get a reduced rate for some of those software programs so administratively we see benefits. I don't have any mayor few. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 15 Summary:**\nI believe out of the 12 or the 10 years that I've been on council it also has been legislated so I don't think there's been an option for us to opt out. How you're going to do it and you're going to revive the plant on a 50 again and and makes small changes and nobody's saying here that they're going to be public hearings on on on this new proposed. Our RRM sprinkled the first density is is one of those can very contentious issues and we're we're studying it there the report 25 to the shelf that's it's not anymore so that's all I can say.

The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants."}, {"name": "2025-03-28_Special_Meeting.mp3", "transcript": " Thank you. We will start the meeting. This is the RM of a Springfield meeting agenda for March 28th of 2025, a special meeting. And we're starting at 10 AM exactly. I'll let you introduce counselors to I am Mayor Patrick Terriyan. Deputy Mayor Ward 1 is a glad fuel to my right. The sending order is award 2 and a kizinski. Next is award 3 counselor Mark Miller, next is award 4 counselor Melinda Warren. Then if we're prepared to go and see that we are adoption of the agenda, can I get a mover and a seconder for the special meeting, mover and a seconder? Mark and Andy? Be it resolved that the special meeting agenda for March 28th be approved. In addition to the agenda as a written, I see none. Can I get a show hands adoption of the agenda? What's unanimous and is it a scary? We got two items on the agenda here. The next is the public recordings of council and the committee meetings and the public hearings. There, I guess we'll get a mover and a seconder for that. Sure, if you could take your hat off and chambers as well, please. Okay, one of we start off then this is a discussion amongst council here. Anybody like to lead us off? Mark? Well, thank you very much, Mayor and council. And we're members of the public. Councilor Kaczynski and I called this special meeting because we think that there's a fundamental freedom of expression and right here for citizens not only in our municipality but fundamentally across Canada and this is echoed by a letter by a group of authorities under the charter advocates Canada who are in the legal field. But beyond that, I just first off want to say that we're thankful that the meeting has been called and it needed to be called because under procedures by-law it's required when any two councillors request a special meeting. It's absolutely essential and necessary. What I'm kind of disappointed in is we didn't really have an opportunity to decide when that meeting would take place. So here we are Friday morning when most people don't have the opportunity to participate despite the inclement weather. Schools are cancelled right across our province. Those people who have children probably would have to stay home for that reason simple enough. Those people who have an 830 to 430 job cannot participate. If you remember it's the excuse might be said, well they can zoom in but you know what? When they're on an hourly clock, they can't zoom in or they're docked pay. Today and I know the roll act took is counselor. I'm taking off time from work for my day job and that's fine. That's my responsibility to do that. I'm not arguing that fact. But what I am arguing is that Joe citizen that does have a regular 9-5 job on a weekday cannot be here today. And I echo that because I was several people have expressed to me their concern with how this chamber since our election has watered away, whittled away and continued to erode democracy for the public. You know we can show primary examples with that with the exclusion and the elimination of question period. That was a fundamental opportunity for the public to engage with our council. That has been stripped away. Take it away. One might say it's democracy, a majority of council supported that proposition. But I will not sit here and say that I supported it because I didn't. The record will show counselor Kaczynski was adamantly opposed to eliminating the opportunity for the public to speak before us. And I'm going to ask you two question period years ago. Count, uh, Reeve, but Narek, Scroopski, McCarthy, Holland. And I'm sure there's been others allowed the public to engage throughout council meetings on point by point matters. And how that any longer we thought I think a previous council thought that taking that away may be more of a format to allow for a question period of 20 minutes or whatever was allowed to engage. And I think that was a good move. I think that was a smart move. What was wrong about that was that it was at the beginning of the agenda items and so people couldn't speak throughout the agenda on particular topics and items. We learned from that that wasn't really the most effective way to do things. But now, 2025, 2025, we've eliminated the public's ability to speak to council. And the argument is you can call us, you can email us, you can text us. But you know what that is? That's called censorship. That's called muslim. That's called suppressing information that could be publicly understood, shared and dealt with. And so I echo with counter, counter, kachinsky. I want to read very specifically what the charter advocates Canada has said. They just challenged, they just challenged the prime minister, the parliament of Canada of a perrogging parliament. This is not some limsey ad hoc. Ridiculous organization that just picks on democracy. They are an organization made up of lawyers that that actually are fighting for freedoms and experience of expression. So if I may read this, well, March 20, 25th from Darren Lang. And it's to the council, the regional municipality of Springfield. Dear mayor and counselors of the RMS Springfield, regarding policy and public meetings of the RMS council. As you know, from our previous correspondence dated September 16th, 2024, charter advocates Canada. Is a charity and civil society organization registered with a law society of Ontario. Our purposes promote constitutional freedoms and human rights across Canada. CAC is dedicated to defending Canada's fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression. Background here, the point out. Ms. Karen Inzley, who's in the audience today in the chamber, is a resident of Springfield, Manitoba, and attended a public meeting of the arm of Springfield, February 4th, 2025. During the public meeting of the arm council, Ms. Inzley recorded a delegation and council chambers on her cell phone cell your phone. Ms. Inzley was sitting quietly with her phone pointed at council to record the proceedings. At some point, Mayor Terian asked whether she was recording and asked her to stop. He stated that it was against the new by-law rules of procedure 2410. The CEO then added that by-law 2410 permitted media to record meetings if they made arrangements. With the CAO, 48 hours prior to public meeting of our council. She also stated that our council would post audio recordings of the meetings within two days of the meeting with notwithstanding unforeseen circumstances. Maritarian then added that it was simply fine for people watching remotely to record the Zoom broadcast. And here they go on to say, and bold points, there is no authority under the by-laws or the municipal act to prohibit members of the public from recording meetings. Very, very bluntly and specifically. As a statutory delegate, arm council's powers must be routed by the act. The act states a council may only act through resolution or by-law. There is no by-law. This is underlined. There is no by-law which prohibits members of the public from recording public meetings of arm council. So this is aside from their letter. Councillor Cachinsky and I saw that there was a notice outside this chamber door saying that recordings aren't permitted. Subsequent to that, Councillor Cachinsky asked the CEO to take down that inappropriate unlawful notice. I see that it's no longer there. Thank you. Section 1510 of the by-law 2410 speaks to arrangements that media must undertake with CEO prior to public meetings. There may or may not be a good basis to have specific arrangements related to media attendance and recording. However, this does not speak to any parameters related to the public recording public meetings they attend. As Ms. Inselies was only quietly sitting and recording the meeting on February 4, 25, it cannot be said nor was it alleged that she was in any way disruptive or engaging in improper conduct contrary to Section 16, a by-law 2410. Further, improper behavior must have legal standards. It must be behavior which disrupts arm council meetings to the extent it negative, effectively affects them. Otherwise, it would be a free ranging power for the chair to expel anyone acting in a way he or she dislikes. And never, never, should that ever happen. The chair cannot arbitrarily declare lawful activities prohibited. Absent, a duly pass resolution for by-law, as there is no by-law or resolution currently prohibiting recording of public meetings. Nor was there improper in conduct. But in the end, there was no authority to prohibit this otherwise legal exercise by a member of the public, my own comment amen. As the Manitoba Court of Appeal held regarding RM councils and by-laws in a rule of the law society such as ours, attention is due. But the rest in fundamental rights can never be forgotten or taken for granted and here we must emphasize that. Not our council, not the legislature of Manitoba, no democratically elected body can take these expressions of freedoms away. Whether they want to or not, there's a charter rights and freedoms and there's higher levels that we must be accountable to. The council duty to respect the Canadian charter rights and freedoms. I can't, but this is a side. I cannot believe that I'm sitting here and we have to deal with this. We should be dealing with fundamental local issues, whether it be the rec center or or road conditions or a whole host of things. And here now we've elevated it to a national issue. Again, going back to the law of the letter. If a by-law or resolution weren't to exist now, we're in the future which completely bans the public from recording meetings. Code, it would be unconstitutional. That is truthful and fact. Recording and broadcasting has been held to be expressive activity protected by section two be of the charter of rights and freedoms. Government owned property which we are on is often required to allow free expression on its premises so long as expression serves to enhance one democratic discourse to truth finding and three self fulfillment. Recording a meeting of RM Council clearly supports all three purposes. A ban on recording diminishes these purposes rather than supporting them. RM Council meetings are by their virtue or by their nature story public. The RM is a public institution and when it holds a public meeting. The free engagement of residents with their RM is a fundamental component of democracy where limitations must be carefully constructed to invite public engagement rather than to constrain it. Although the RM publishes its own recordings through its own processes, there is no reasonable basis to prevent the public from recording meetings except where such activity is coupled with disruptive or improper conduct already prohibited. Furthermore, the act highlights the importance of public nature of such meetings where it requires all meetings of council to be conducted in public subject limited exceptions. The more interrupts are RM Council meetings are not forums where witnesses testify where quality of evidence could be impacted by public attending tenants recording such as in a court proceeding. However, the importance of what takes place in an RM Council meeting is similar to a court proceeding where the public has a significant interest to know what takes place. Perfectly reasonable for the public to obtain such information from the recordings published by the RM Council itself with all its limitations. And as you know, when we do have recordings, there are sometimes issues with muting lack of video technical difficulties. We saw that last night. We saw that last night where people on zoom couldn't. Again, it was because of perhaps air or technical difficulties. It wasn't intentional, but it comes extinct from the recordings or by other attendees who may publish their own recordings to bring awareness to specific issues addressed at the RM meeting. If the mayor supports the public to record the council's own broad cast with its limitations. As he stated on February 4th, 2025, then there is no reason that the public should not record the meeting directly unless the mayor's intention is to control publication of the meeting subject to the limitations inherent in the council's publication of the meeting. So here's the conclusion. All actions of the RM Council must have legal authority in either the act by law or resolution. So long as members of the public record in a non-destructive manner, such as in Miss Inley's case, the RM Council and chair have no legal basis to prohibit recordings at their meetings. We invite the RM Council to consider our concerns cautiously and to conduct meetings in a way respectful to charter rights. We hear in demand that the chair forth with cease denying Miss Inley or any other resident who attends a public meeting in person from recording the meetings. As long as it is done in a non-destructive manner, you're a truly charter advocates of Canada. Again, this is a recent letter just about a week old and it's gaining national attention on media. And I'm sure if we don't do the right thing, we don't take the high bar on this. It'll gain national and perhaps international attention. We need to absolutely encourage transparency, openness and engagement by the public always and forever. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Councillor Miller. Anybody else? Councillor Cousinski. Yes. Not our phone. Not our end. I cannot hear Mr. Cousinski. Okay. Yes, I do not mute myself. I'm sorry. Okay, so I want to say that we as a council, when I was running for council, I never expected that we going to be fighting for the rights for the residents of this community. I think we have to put the rights was Trump or over and over again, and I think we have to put stop to it. And we should have more rights for the citizens, you know, because we hear representing our citizens. We're not representing ourselves. So I have small presentations here. As a council, we should be open and transparent as possible with the resident we represent. We also even campaign for open transparent and accountable government. The subject of the meeting in section 1510 of the procedure by law. Section 1510 is clear to me and that it does not restrict the public from recording meetings. Unfortunately, some council members and the administration do not have the same understanding. The letter we are presented from the chart of buckets should should clearly clarify and confusing them a council and administration. However, that it's still not the case. Dr. Page make a request for permission to record here today and he was denied. And I don't know why. The chart and article that led their own ask that if a by law or resolution were to exist. Now, or in a future which completely burns the public from recording meetings, it would be unconstitutional. Dr. Page, the night request demonstrate that our by law does not an effect on the public from recording. Also, may a terian ordering people and audience not to record proceeding exceeding his authority because there is no restriction and a procedure by law that authorized him to do that. This is not in line with the chart of rights. I recommend to each change this section 1510 of the procedure by law so that it does not violate the chart of rights. We would not want the chart to advocate to decide to take action on this issue, which we lead to unnecessary legal fees, which come out of the. The package of the hardworking springfield rate payers. Council, we should embrace the public rights and we should not fear an open and transparent government. Thank you. Thank you, Councillor. Anybody else before a summit a lot. Deputy Mayor. So I'll speak towards the question period for a sec. I just want to reiterate that that's not true with what was said. We do have delegations. Members residents can come forward with a delegation. We changed all that. We even have questions that can be answered through sending them in. So I believe everybody has opportunity to submit as we noticed in the last few meetings. We have to make sure that the decisions are even filling up. We've had like one or two delegations. There's not eight delegations on every meeting. So again, if people want to come in as delegations, they're open. Having said that. Going towards the medium. I again, I'll bring up 15.10. I believe that the public should be able to record. But they have to again do it in a proper way. We don't need every person in the in the in the in the chamber. Tapping with their cell phones. So again, there has to be ways of doing this properly. So I recommend on passing a resolution. That on 15.1 that we state. Public and media may audio video take meetings proceedings, including public hearings. Providing that the arrangements are made with the CAO at least two days, 48 hours prior to the meeting or public hearings. And I so moved. That motion. Council. Okay. Then also. I get an opportunity. Right. So I've done a lot of. I guess. Melinda is muted. Your beautiful and. Sorry about that. So I've done a lot of research as well on this issue. And reading the. All the all the information about recording in the public and you're in a public area. You know, I've read all that. But it still comes back to. And I think, I think a. I think a. Just. Um, Oh. Uh, Dandel page may not want to be audio or video. And. Honestly, If you're here in council chamber. And you get permission. I'm okay with that. Um. people come to council chambers for information. That's why they come. And so I also looked at a couple different, more than a couple, different municipalities out there. And Westean Paul allows people to end a media public end a media to audio video with permission. Eastean Paul also allows people with permission. The RM of lack of money does not allow. And unless you have a issue where you need to be audio, like you need to have the audio. The city of Winnipeg does not allow you to audio in their gallery, or video, sorry. So I am an agreement that, you know, if you're coming to council and you're videoing it for informational purposes, and it is, it is in factual, truthful information. I don't see the issue. I don't want to see people that just come to a council meeting and you wonder why people don't come to a council meeting is because they may not want to have their face out there because they might not agree with you. So I would respect that person's ethical choice to not be. And we should all be understanding of people that don't want to be on your video. But if you come and you get permission, a few days before that you're concerned and you want to video, I don't see the major issue. Just to, just to, you know, I don't want to see everybody there with their phones up, be respectful. And that's all I'm asking. Because if somebody comes and they have their children and the audience, we have to respect that because you are not too audio or video, sorry, children without their parents consent. Glenn, did you make a resolution there? And you seconded it there, there? So then we could proceed with a resolution but I have a narrative first. Like everybody's had a turn except for myself. What all do here is, because of the special meeting, I've got all the my notes down here, scrambled. We've been elected on council for two and a half years approximately not to the last month as cameras and chambers have been an issue at all. At all. We as elected officials, question period and invocation in December of 2024. We as elected officials turned it down past the resolution that question period was to be taken off procedural bylaw. There is a mention there about the national media disruptions and so on like that. Disruption in local governance is gotten totally on the hand in cell phones in my understanding or main portion with regards to that. We as elected officials have to respect the people's privacy. And let's not get anything wrong here today. This is all about question period short and simple. So we as council have to move forward and we are consumed in putting out fires which slows our governance on major issues. Bailas on our communities, only applicable to our 1100 square miles of our beautiful RM here. We as council take an oath to conduct ourselves and best interests of the role-medist Pali of Springfield. Section 1510 of the procedural bylaw states media are allowed to record a 40-hour prior application is done. Again, we have adhered to this for two and a half years but since December now we have to interpret it or be asked to interpret it otherwise. Are we to put everything possible every variance? New ons when it comes to stating who media is there. To say it doesn't say this in short and sweet there, it's for good governance there to allow cell phones in here would be an absolute disruption. This is why I feel that having recordings is counterproductive in counterproductive to good governance. It's disruptive when you could have 43 video cameras in the chambers at any one time, potentially 43. When a camera decorum will often deteriorate, we've seen it there when cameras are present there when you exponentially increase out to 43, it's gonna heighten everybody's sensitivities and arousals. I didn't sign up here in nor anybody in the audience to be on YouTube, Facebook or social media. Much like crowd mentality, cameras change people in groups, people act in different ways. They can do so by recording off of Zoom. That's, I've said that repeatedly. The public are hesitant to attend chambers, especially if they have a different view from a group or people present. We wanna attract people into the chambers here. Not we wanna attract people that are not always present. We wanna attract a wide variety of people into the R.M. Having people now have to worry about being on Facebook and social media to some persons website is counterproductive to allow for a better environment to bring people back. They should not have to worry about stuff like social media. I think accounts are definitely mayor as basically said other comments that are basically been repeated. If you give me one moment. Thank you. Councilor Miller. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just wanna read, but, but, Councillor Fiel said he made allegations that people have the opportunity to speak as delegations. Yes. You did make that statement only moments ago. Dr. Daniel Page made a request to be a delegation today. He was denied. So, you cannot say to me, no one can say that because we have question period, people can come as delegations. When there's an individual in our chamber, specifically right now, who is denied. Other people wanted to speak as delegations have come forward to me, but they said, unfortunately, they did not have 48 hours notice as required. So, they're not able to participate. They're not able to share their concerns with Council today. So, the delegation approach, while I know Councilor Fiel had good intention for it, it is ineffective. It's censoring the public. It's giving them the inability and prohibiting them to come forward to our Council. Because often, often, and you know this, we get the agenda on Friday at 430 or 4 o'clock. People actually have lives outside of this Council chamber. And on the weekends, they probably don't stay tuned. And they don't at 430 tuned into the website of the arm of Springfield and say, oh, yeah, this is on the agenda. And then all of a sudden, it comes about a Monday, and they don't have the opportunity, the 48 hours notice to speak as a delegation. So, that whole element of the procedures by law is ineffective. And it, again, is a mechanism where we've watered down the ability of the public to speak. I would love it. I would make a motion here and now. And I'm sure it would be seconded for the public to engage with us at this special meeting here today. So, I will make that resolution as well. That the public have the opportunity to today speak to us as Council on this emergency, very critical, national charter of rights, fundamental issue to speak to us here and now. And I would need somebody to seconder. That's the end. Can I just clarify there was no request for a delegation that was denied for this meeting, so I'm not sure. Well, I believe there was. And no, there was a request to record the meeting, not come as a delegation. Okay, I have had to clarify that. Okay, to go further than, I have had requests, but people knew they couldn't meet the 48 hours notice. So, regardless, people do not have the ability to speak to us. I'm giving them right now the opportunity to speak to us. What's wrong with that? Is this Council not want to hear from the people? And just on the point of Councilor Warren, just because others are doing it inappropriately or wrong doesn't make it right. And you know what fundamentally, this is a public chamber. And do you realize that if you're in a public chamber, you're allowed to be video recorded? And if you bring your children in here, that is an authorization to allow that child to be video recorded. You don't need approval. Show me any specific evidence that shows that you cannot record in a public chamber. You can't do it. It's not possible, because it doesn't exist. And it's against the freedoms of rights. And the charter. So we are, we're a position ourselves. Whatever happens in your resolution, Mr. Councillor Feewell, this is gonna go to a higher level and it's becoming a national issue. It's not gonna be smothered and dealt with. It's gonna be raised up higher, higher, higher, and make us look like. Goons. Goons. Well, a national, I don't quite understand. That's just one lawyer company. That's one lawyer. We have many lawyers that would say otherwise. I, I was, well, no, this is just one, this is just one new independent opinion. This is just one person opinion. It's a group of lawyers. It's, it's, it's just opinion. It doesn't, it doesn't. This is one lawyer's opinion. You're, you're putting everything, put your hand down, Mr. Page. This is just one lawyer's opinion there. And there's other lawyers there. If this lawyer, just company here wants to make an issue about that, tell them to take it to the, to the Manitoba Court of Appeals. I make a King Spence application. And then, then go ahead. But this is, this is something that all our AMs have to deal with in a vast majority do not allow cameras in here. And there's a reason for that. The vast majority do not allow question period. We are not doing anything wrong here. We're not, well, anybody, we're not stomping on anybody's rights for you to be, in order to say stuff like that, that's, that's being overly, I am talking, I am talking to say, to say, you're saying, please stop by, interrupting in the chamber. Just stop just being disrespectful, okay? Mr. Akins. You are, I'm trying to talk here and you're trying to override me here. So, so the fact, the fact is, is that you've got one lawyer company here why we're putting everything on this one. I don't understand this. We have got many different opinions on this. So to say that, everything is on one letter here is, is beyond me, why we're, we're putting everything on this. This hasn't been tested in court. If they want to test this in court, please do so. But we're allowed on a municipal act. We're required to have a procedural by law. We've addressed that. And there's now been an issue since question period was taken away, playing in simple. So let's handle the resolution there of deputy mayor first. Two, two resolutions. So let's handle the first one first. He doesn't get it. Council Miller. Mr. Mayor, I don't know why you continued discredited charter advocates Canada. I'm not discredited. What did you just say? This is just one, he's not a lawyer. He's not speaking here. They can note, he's not, he's interrupting me now. So he wants respect, but nobody else can have respect, right? This is how this guy acts. This is how our mayor conducts council meetings. Since day one, I'm frustrated. You can see my frustration. And you want us to, he doesn't want people to see who he is. Excuse me, can I just remind council that we do have a procedure by law? And if I could read that, members of the public may not interrupt any speaker or action of the council and behave in a disorderly manner, including engaging in debate or conversation. Thank you. That's clearly a rule on the table. Just be respectful. So I was speaking, Mr. Mayor, in terms of respect, well, obviously we don't have any of that. We haven't had it for a long time. You've called me names. You've done other intimidating kinds of things. I'm sick of it. I'm tired of it. And this is going to go to the human rights. This is a story, the charter of rights and freedoms. Because now, now the public has drawn a wall. You've drawn a wall between you as an elected official and the public as the people out there who need to abide by everybody law that we have and a new one that they want to institute today to even further restrict you. To even further restrict the public, how much erosion of democracy are we going to see in the next one in the three quarters year until you and I and others face the electorate? And judge you. This has been an notorious erosion. This has been a legacy that is atrocious for every member of this council. Why are we seeing in such a bad light because we're eroding the public's ability to engage into democratically dialogue? They don't have that in other municipalities because frankly, people are allowed to dialogue and engage and have a good report. It's important for us to have a difference of opinion. That absolutely is true, but it has never, ever right to go against the charter of rights and freedoms or the public. And that's exactly the path. The roadway you're going. Do you not see that? The charter of rights and freedoms was brought in by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to make sure that the people had the ability to continuously dialogue with the elected officials, not because your opinion is that people are disrespectful. You know what? Don't always like your opinion or mine. And they have the ability. They should have the right to express their disappointment with Councillor Miller, Councillor Fughl, Councillor Warren, Councillor Cachinsky, and Maritarian. Absolutely, that's a fundamental. That's enough. You're a disruptive here. What kind of an attitude is that? So let's do the resolution. Let's do the resolution. Fundamental rights of freedoms and people is, is really what we're fighting for as Canada as a nation. We have the charter of rights and freedoms which is unique within the democratic elected world. And for you and any member who's gonna vote against the public to go against the charter of rights and freedoms, I will stand firm, I'll go on social media, I'll go on national news, I'll go wherever it takes to ensure the public in our municipality have a continued right to speak to us. This is how ridiculous it is. And this is where it's going. Deputy Mayor. I totally agree with you. They will have a right in an organized matter. And that's how it will be done in my opinion. And that's why I put through this motion. Thank you. Okay, can we have the resolution or wording for the resolution? So there is a resolution. We're talking outside. Move by Councillor Fiel and seconded by Councillor Warren. Be it resolved that by law 24-10 section 15.10. Be amended at the first available time to the public and the media may audio videotape meeting proceedings, including public hearings, providing that arrangements are made with the CAO at least two days, 48 hours prior to the meeting or public hearing. With that resolution being read, those in support from council, we can speak to the resolution first. Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Again, this is another barrier to exclude the public as councilor Fiel says. Yes, it gives them the ability, but it puts up such barriers that people just won't do it. In fact, there'll be even less people who are intent to come to speak to council because they'll see it as some sort of authoritarian type of an institution that prohibits and restricts and makes allegations. And Mr. Mayor, I just heard you say to Mr. Mackie that take your comments outside this chamber. So in other words, throwing out people is the way you did say it, it's on the record. But so this is the kind of attitude. Why would I as a resident want to come to this chamber? If I was in your seat and on elected official, I would say to heck with it, what's going to count is next election. When I throw the people who have prohibited me and restricted me, those are the people we're going to get out of this seat. And that's going to be a fundamental election priority. And it's going to be well well presented. Those who support the public and those who put up barriers, restrictions and say, yes, you can come to talk to us, but you have to meet all this criteria. And by the way, the CEO can say yes or no. So you don't even get past that poll. The democracy's eroded is gone. This is beyond belief. Okay, we've ready to vote then. With that resolution being read, maybe we'll read it again just for clarity there. Okay, and I just want to clarify that the rules are quite clear that in the bylaw that Council set under 2410 on why delegations can be denied. So it's not just me being willy-nilly on when I deny delegations. So I just I want that to be clear. Thank you. Just be a representative. Just rupt of Mr. Akins. Be it resolved bylaw 24-10. Section 15.10 be amended at the first available time to the public and the media may audio videotape meeting proceedings including public hearings, providing that arrangements are made with the CEO at least two days, 48 hours prior to the meeting or public hearing. Those in support of the reading is specified there, show hands. Let me answer one and a few. Those opposed. Maritarian Miller and Kaczynski. Where do I, I'm gonna read that again? I'm gonna remind. So I'm just gonna remind Council about public the forum at meeting. Bring on. Don't worry about it. It's fine. I'm just gonna remind the public what's written in the procedure bylaw regarding engaging in debate in the Council chambers during a meeting. That's, that's this, the way it's written here, I'll say it again, be resolved at the bylaw 24-10, 15-10, be amended at the public and the media may audio videotape the main meeting with the proceedings. And the hearings are providing that arrangements are made with the CEO at least two days prior to that. So essentially allowing people to video and audio tape and I'm opposed to that. That's not what you voted. That, I'm just gonna. Second resolution. I would eat the second resolution and I hope Council Miller gonna be here. Maybe we can ask him to come back. Are you moving us resolution? Yes, I will. We have quorum, so the meeting can proceed. You're tanking. Yeah, I'm gonna present the resolution. Be resolved at the Council of Rural Municipal Affairs Pranker approved section 5.2, 10 of bylaw number 24, 10 be amended to the public and the media may audio videotape or digitally recorded meeting proceedings, including public hearings. Is that not just the resolution we already voted on? So can I get a copy of that, please? Thank you. Okay, it seems like the same resolution to me, but I will read it out again, moved by Councillor Kuzinski and seconded by Councillor Miller. Be resolved at Council of the RMS Prankfield approved section 15.10 of bylaw number 24, 10 be amended to the public and media may audio videotape or digitally record meeting proceedings, including public hearings. No, what, sorry. That's a couple of reports. Okay, kind of get a show hands of those in support of that. That's Councillor Miller and Councillor Kuzinski. Those opposed. That's Councillor Warren, Councillor Puhull and Mayor Terri. Pointer, sorry. To order, there was no debate on this discussion. I rule it the vote not to- We've been debating it- It doesn't matter how long. You debate it when the resolution is made. Mr. Mayor, if you know- If you know Robert's real- You don't see the answer, I don't see the answer. I'm not going to be. He's not, again, giving me the ability to speak. Why is that that he interjects because he wants his point of view? It was unconstitutional. It was not according to Robert's rules of order and I know you're going to discredit it because you're going to say it's not, but you know what, there is procedure. And any legislative body elected body has to go by procedure. Otherwise, again, it's a banana republic. It is not. We just voted on it there. What was the vote? He doesn't- Mayor doesn't even know what he did wrong. Call it- Missy- We just voted a second time here. What was the vote? There's no discussion. There's no discussion. So, okay. Banana court. We've been talking for the last hour on this. Did you get the vote to there? Well, the matter is defeated. It's the same resolution and this one is defeated. It is defeated. Go ahead. Go ahead. It is. Okay, you're being disrupted. There's no problem. The record will show it. The second resolution was the same as the first. This is the butcher of the minutes. Last night, we saw that the minutes were inaccurate from a change so it could. If this is the kind of municipality we've worked in, shameful. Absolutely. Okay. Okay. I'll make a motion to adjourn. And I'm going to move her in a second or plus. This is a bit for point two. We have. We have done four point two. We've been talking about four point one and four point two. Four point one was dealt with four point two isn't. This is, you know, you sometimes interest came and get so frustrated. You say, exactly. All right, go ahead. You've been talking about chart advocates the whole time here, Mark. Now all of a sudden we're going to go back into charted advocates. You've been talking about four point one and four point two. Mr. Mayor. Councillor Getsinski and I made another motion that the public have the ability to speak at this meeting here and now. And why do you just evade it and say the meeting's done? Because it's not in what you want to do. Okay. Well, let's, what's your wording there for the resolution? Do I have everybody to talk as a delegation? I think the CEO had that resolution and it's written a recording. I can't verbate them. Remember 10 15 minutes ago, what I said, but it was to the extent that I moved that the public have the ability to speak here and now to us regarding these issues. And that, okay, enough. This isn't a dialogue. This is just with council here. You need a lot of help. See, he's mulled thing back to the public. I think that's irresponsible and inappropriate. Oh, whatever, Mark. It's, well, that's a code of conduct. I'm going to submit. So I apologize, Councillor Caisinski. Do you have a motion on the floor that has been voted on? Enough. Let us talk here and stop disrupting. So council voted on that. It was defeated two to three. So now the second motion now is to allow the public. But Councillor Miller have motion that people allow people to speak. And I second that, but kind of was lost. Nobody react to it. There we'll do it now. No, this is what we do with Mark. Yeah, this is what we deal with Mark. Again, harassment of comments. It is not. You make a comment and I can make a comment. So smart enough. Disrespectful. I'm going to make that note to the human resources department. Disrespect in council. I'm getting tired of it. I'm frustrated by it. And I think it's insulting and demeaning. Thank you, Mr. Herr. For being so courteous. So respectful to your fellow council members. Shameful. Absolutely despicable. So I'm just wondering, does council actually want to enforce their procedure by law and public to coordinate meetings? Or just ignore that it exists. I don't know. Go ahead, Dupymer. Yes, we have a by law in place for a reason. I believe that that what it should be. So hopefully without being interrupted, I can read the motion. That's on the table ready to be voted on. Please do. Move by Councillor Miller, seconded by Councillor Cousinsky. Be resolved that the public be allowed to speak about the agenda items on March 28, 2025. Those in support. Now, so it's a Miller and Cousinsky. Those opposed. Cousins was worn, fuel and terrient sold the night. So that should be it. There's there any other motions that we're not aware. It was none. Then I get a move on a seconder to adjourn, please. Councillor's Presenceky in fuel. And the matters adjourned at 10.54. Thank you. Record will show.

Okay, if we're so will start off with number five, the planning matter is non public hearing. Five point one, request for a letter of concurrence. SLI towers, I'll put handed over to the. Plan director, Dan. I'll get you done with yourself, please. First item on the agenda is a request for a letter of concurrence from a communication tower. Company, SLI towers. They have followed the protocol under the I said requirements. The reports were provided to council. They want to install a. 213 put self supporting engineered tower within the northeast quarter of nine, ten four. This is just along the south perimeter perimeter highway. The communications, sorry, because communications and wireless service are federally regulated. Municipal bylaws and regulations do not apply, but the tower company still require Council's letter of concurrence. They provided a 30 day notification period, which was done through local at news paper ads. And also have sent out circulation to the surrounding landowners. We have not received any comments, any concerns or objections on this tower. And if council were to consider this application, there was a resolution that was drafted for consideration. Thank you. Is there any questions from council for Dan? You know, ask that's we move that the for the concurrence of the letter. Your mover. Andy and Mark. Now, therefore, be resolved that the development officer be authorized to provide the required correspondence relating to the letter of concurrence for the construction of a new wireless communications installation. At 55108 Dawson Road within the northeast quarter nine ten four east. Okay, so we get a motion to our, no, we have the motion, sorry. Can get a vote to in in favor. All improved. Move. Go on to five point two planning development plan amendment by loft 2502 agriculture preserve to employment. I'll get down to read the planning. We have. By law 2502 this is the first reading of a development plan amendment. The first reading of the foundation was made by Mr Wayne 80 of ED farms limited. The development plan is to re designate the property being the southeast quarter of 36104. Excluding the power transmission line plan 7753 for this land being redesign. I have a cultural preserve area to to employment land. The applicant is seeking to re designate the quarter section being 155 acres for industrial purposes. Mr. ED intends to subdivide approximately 20 acres of land for an industrial parcel, the proposed development. There has been no conceptual plans submitted only a rough site plan of severing off the first 20 acres. I provided to council the report in within the report under section 4.1 some of the agricultural policies under the development plan. This land is currently predominantly. The soil classifications are class three with some class two soils within the area. It's not immediately adjacent to existing employment land. There is a about a half mile of agricultural preserve between the two between the the parcel and the other employment lands the existing designation. So if council were to consider this if council were to consider the following development plan amendment. I offer the following resolution to be motion for council for discussion and consideration. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions from council. Mark. Thank you Mr. Deputy Mayor. So my first question of course would be to the development. Planning officer in terms of re designating this land. Does that take away from the thrust of preserving our obviously agricultural land. In other words, is it being farm predominantly now? You indicated of course the classes of soils and how would those soils be protected if we do support this proposal. The lands are currently being cultivated correct. They are a high class of soil capacity. One way to I guess protect the actual physical soil on top is to strip the land and then preserve it later on. I could foresee when this get circular if council grants first first reading. Then we have to circulate it to the provincial departments. I believe department of agriculture will be opposed to this. Excellent and do you know what the proponent plans to do without I know it's redesign it perhaps is industrial or so forth. But is it to put some sort of factories or other buildings steel frame buildings like is there any detail to what the intent is going forward. On the total 155 acre parcel. No one for the residual on the 20 acre parcel out of the 155. I had some preliminary discussions of the industrial building going on there that needed high capacity. Hydral power for that type of business. And that was one of the reasons they had selected this location. So I'm certainly for economic development particularly for our M. Again, I think the province will buy in into the second stage of it in terms of how we preserve that soil with their piece pulling it away or what not. That's kind of the safeguard isn't it going forward. That the province the next step would be having the province review this file. Yes, putting conditions potentially on it. So the province will circulate it to the various agencies will get comments back from those agencies and then will present it to council. Great, thank you for your information. The applicant is in the gallery if council did have any questions strictly for the applicant again, it's not a public hearing for the public but if council has questions from a street. Anybody next to I have I have just a couple questions here like this parcel of land. When I look at it and I and I it's a mile from highway 207 and a mile from highway 15 if I'm not mistaken. And it's in the middle of farming culture. And when you if you're going to start employment in the middle of. I'm going to say this very nicely in the middle of a farm area. What are you looking for for the future because we have a development plan that has certain areas of this municipality for certain employment industrial. And we want to we always talk about preserving our agricultural land. And I guess I'm. I sit there as a as a counselor but I also sit there as a resident knowing that. Yes, I had I have a business next to me. So if I'm on a five acre 10 acre. I don't really want employment next to me. Which I have currently. So you got to look at. Where it's located. What the development plan kind of says for like you don't want to have that over here that over there that over there that over there you need it. In certain areas. That's just my comment on that like. Yeah, okay. Anybody else mark and I would be consistent to what councilor Warren says, but maybe the development officer can can chime in on this or the applicant as you say is here. Maybe they can give their perspective if it's allowed. If if council wants my opinion sure. We are leapfrogging existing development. We are on primary agricultural land. I'm not going to I don't think it's it's a great location for this type of business right there. There are other lands nearby. And we could do a detailed analysis for council when it comes to the public hearing. This is just to bring it on the table as Mr. Ede had made the application. Go ahead. And Mr. Deputy Mayor are we allowed in to have the applicant because I would like to hear perhaps his perspective just to give us some insight to before. Yeah, I agree. I was just going to ask the applicant to come up and speak if he wishes. Wayne. Good evening, counselors. I'm Wayne Edie from ED farms on the owner of the property. No one who's making the application. First of all, all the clarifying location location is on south wind road. One half mile east of 207. And it would be also be that would make it one half mile west of fine redrowed. It butts right up against the existing high roll yard where they store their towers. Yeah, so it's not out in the center of a. Of a quarter section per se. It's but it right against some land that is already used for industrial. Yeah, reason for the application to put it there is because. The intended site is to be used for what's called the data center. Now, a data center needs a large large amount of hydro electricity power to run. And the. A possible purchaser has got an application into the manateau. And so to see how much power the hydro will give them. But that's being the main reason for wanting to be where they're at. Now, as for anyone nearby, there is no houses or anything within a half a mile in any direction of this. Like I say, it's but it right up against high rows existing. Yard yard site. That's the location of it. So Wayne, I have a question to that certainly. Looking at the map and I kind of am familiar with you. Seven there that yard there is more of I think there is a building on that yard that you're saying, but it's not zone employment lands. Then that piece that hydro owns and is that what we're saying. No, from what I understand, it never was changed over when I had high real put their yards out there. They've kind of got a little bit of a special agreement, I guess, that you would say. No, so maybe Dan could fit in on that. Yeah, and if you could clarify that for us. There's no special agreement. What it is is. Sorry, I'm getting echo. The Manitoba Hydro Act over. What's the word I'm looking for? Super seeds the planning act. So Hydro can go anywhere. They can establish any any yard site, any infrastructure facility without complying with zoning. They are established in agricultural zones industrial zones. These were just zones that were or designations we had done with the development plan to recognize a water treatment plan. And then they expanded further to the east where they have a bit of a storage yard for their cable, which is kind of that. You can see it in the aerial photo, but a little faint. There's an old gravel pad between 207 and the half mile off-suffin. Thank you. It comes with any other questions. Go ahead, Andy. Hi, Manitoba. Hi, Manitoba. So how much long this business going to take it from this. What they're looking for initially is 20 acres and the reason for 20 acres, they're going to use 10 acres for the building plus parking. And then they want to use you know, other remaining 10 acres for green space. So they're after 20 acres. For the for the start. Now the reason for applying for the whole quarter section is there's a spin off of a data center. And one of it is they produce a large amount of heat, which they need to disperse. So what they're looking at is partnering up with the agriculture producer, IE someone who's in the greenhouse business. And they can heat these greenhouses from the excess heat from the data center. So that's the reason for pointing up the data center. Well, first of all, you need to pony up the data center next to the hydro because they need an extremely amount of reliable power. And then the phase two, if you want to call it that, is greenhouses and agricultural facilities right next to the data center that can use the excess heat that they just have. And then the excess heat that they generate. That's the reason and you know, thinking outside the blocks for future development, that's why I'd like to sub or rezone the whole 155 acres. And if you look at it on the map, which stands been doing it is quite isolated. It's really in the middle of of other farmland that's owned by Manitoba hydro and everything else around that. So it's not like we're pointing up next to residential houses this is anyway. I do have some information on the data center that I brought the felt you made in water, know about IE, amount of water they use and, you know, the noise from the fans it'll be cooling the facility. I've got all that and they also've got a couple of developers that would cut gladly come down and give you a full presentation and what's involved in the data center. So my next question did you go and talk with neighbors that in the area like he said, I have not yet because we've not got to that step, but like I say there really isn't any neighbors per se within a half a mile. I know them all personally, I gladly talked them before, you know, this gets any further along. I can't see any objection Andy if that's the thinking, but they'll definitely talk to them before. Deepened out there, far more than that's there, you know, the landowners that we should say, yeah, well, the landowners immediately to this south. There's a three quarters of a section actually a whole section, which I lease from hydro hydro actually owns that property and the everything to the north. I own that property for the next two miles and if you go to the east and south there's another section there and I own that one as well. And as well as on the next section over there's another quarter section that's owned by hydro and I lease that as well. So really we're locating this in that area for that reason because it's really open the middle of nowhere. And there's not a lot of, you know, any light pollution anything like that, it won't matter because hydro's right next to them and they've got there or yard sight lit and up as you've probably noticed. But the main reason to put it there is because of the large amount of electricity that they're going to be using to run this situation. And that's the reason for my application for the zoning change. And really we are budding right up against employment land like I say the hydro yard is right there they may not be zoned employment, but they're right there. Thank you. Thank you. Question for the planning officer that's just one title there on that 155 acres. The there's one title. But the one title includes the southern quarter and the northern quarter. So you have so it's the whole east half that is the titled property. Mysteries only making application on the southern portion of that title property. Thank you Mister deputy mayor so just a question because you would probably had the answer. And sounds like crypto currency which is which is generally. No, that's about yeah. So that doesn't matter the question is, would you be opposed to them stripping off what is their eight inches of soil. None whatsoever. No, it's actually should be recommended take the top so the way save the top so early and back fill it was filling our location to the city of Winnipeg. They'll have a pretty easy way of getting filled all back in and you need to build up the level a little bit anyway to. Another thing that with this site it's got perfect drainage the big ditch is right there on the other side of south win road. So you can drain it to the south street in the south way road win road it fires into the slightly it's not going to get. Planned out in the middle of the section somewhere. I just say absolutely and you're no stranger to this and I know there's value to that top soil as well whether you sell it to. Yes. If they want to strip it off, I'll give them a place to put it. Great next door fantastic. Thank you. Okay, any other questions? No thanks. Wait no, thanks. Okay, if I can get a motion on the floor. For the. Uh, bar transmission line from agriculture preserve area to employment. A mover. Sorry. Andy second by. Linda. Sorry. Beer is all that first reading. Be given to buy law number 2502 being a bylaw of the arm a springfield to redesignate all those lands within the southeast quarter 36104. Excluding power transmission line plan 7753 from agricultural preserve area to employment as shown on appendix A. So if I can get a vote on in favor. And against. So it's two to defeated. Thank you.

And none those in favor. Not this time and those in opposition. Not at this time. I'll get a mover. I'll close the public hearing first get mad myself again. I'll get this down right yet. Is this all a mover please Andy and seconder Melinda. Where is a public hearing has been conducted under the planning act to consider an application filed by tell the holdings court on behalf of Michael tell it on behalf of cam Henry holding zinc owner of the property located at 51 Mathison Parkway for a conditional use under the Springfields only by one number. And we're going to go to the next slide. We're going to go to the next slide. Where is counsel satisfied that the requirements apart seven conditional uses has been met. Be a result that conditional use order number 25. One be granted subject to the four conditions. Okay, I get a vote in favor. Carry. We'll move to six point three development plan amendment by law 24 11 agriculture preserve to employment second reading water side developments on that over to Dan for the planning report. We have. Mr. Bill McGarry president of water side development corp owner of the property has made an application for a development plan amendment for lot 134 plan for 33. Within within the south west quarter of 29 at 10 for the applicant seeks to redesignate the property from agricultural preserve to employment. Mr. McGarry intends to subdivide the approximate 17.4 acres to create additional industrial lots including an internal municipal road. No conceptual plans were provided as of yet with this application. The subject property is currently designated agricultural preserve area under the development plan 18 and dash. Oh, nine. I have submitted sections of. The agricultural preserve policies as well as the employment. I'm a map of the employment of what's existing. To the north there is the existing employment land of water side development to the south is land owned by the department of highways being the transcan and highway and to the west is some land. That is owned by the railway to the east there is a small portion of agricultural preserve land adjacent to this proposed site. The bylaw was circulated to various departments agencies surrounding municipalities and planning districts. At the time of the report was written we had received no letters of objections. Nor have we received we've only received the comments from the city of Winnipeg which were part of the provincial comments. The provincial comments were referred to the various agencies mandatory agriculture indicated that while this is an existing small holding being 17.4 acres. It reflects a loss of primary agricultural land and it is unclear of its redesignation is necessary at this point given the large amount of vacant employment land directly adjacent to the parcel in question. Manitoba agriculture expressed concerns from any agricultural perspective any commercial industrial should be directed to those areas currently designated. The employment before expanding new areas but please note that Manitoba agriculture did not formally object. Manitoba infrastructure stated that in response to an email dated November 25th 2024 we have reviewed the above. The development plan amendment the intent is to redesign that the subject site from agricultural preserve area to employment area in order to accommodate future commercial and or industrial development the land. In redesignated has frontage along plesie based on all available information we do not object to this amendment I will not continue with the rest of their paragraph it's was provided to council and also on the municipal website. We want to pay had comments regarding land drainage they wanted to as a subject site will be draining onto the city of want to pay land drainage infrastructure as the water travels from east to west. We want a condition for any future development that they need to submit a comprehensive land drainage technical memorandum prepared by a qualified municipal engineer to the satisfaction to the water and waste department. We want to talk about rainfall events of 525 and 100 year events. Those would normally be placed as a condition within a subdivision application not necessarily a development plan amendment. With their traffic division would also like a traffic impact study for any future developments if this were to expand in the future and again that would be a condition of a subdivision and not necessarily a development plan amendment. The following departments and agencies either had no concerns or no comments to the amendment being the lands and planning branch the mines branch. Bill MTS, Meditable Hydro MIT Hydrologic Forecasting and Water Management, Historic Resource Branch, Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Branch and CP Real. Municipal Relations Community Planning stated that in accordance with section 41 of the Planning Planning Act the development plan. Sorry the development plan by law 24 to 11 is generally consistent with the land use policies in the provincial planning regulation community planning recommends that council. Giving considerations of any objections received at the public hearing so basically they had no no objections to this proposal being community planning if council were to. Consider this development plan amendment I would offer the following resolution to be discussed and considered by council. Thank you deputy mayor fuel. Thank you is the applicant here. Would you like to add anything to that. You come up and state your name. I'm Bob do what I'm with the applicant. And my tool to postpone this matter until next month. The reason being I contacted Matt O'Bagger cultural this morning by email delay that wrote the letter with concerns asked for some data on the net loss of farmland as the result of burden expansion. She hasn't ever responded and I think her letter is important. I think she's a little bit more. You have anything to add he's asking to defer it. Until next month. Yeah I understand that. Yeah I have no problem with him deferring especially if it's. Yeah, I receive reply from her. I'll pass it on to Dan. Okay. Give a vote on that to defer. That's deferred. Thank you. I have that with the deferral we will have to re re notify when it comes back to. When the additional information comes back we're going to have to repost everything. The circulation within the newspaper. Posting it on the property and the surrounding landowners. So but there are our requirements under the act for timelines. So might not go to the February meeting it might go to the March meeting so just be aware of that. Okay. Okay. So I just wonder if I could verify with the development officer if council states the date and time now. Do you still have to do the advertising? No we don't. Okay. But we don't know when the literature is going to come in. That's the challenge. Okay. Thank you. As you that's our last item. Excuse me. Excuse me. Good. Under the planning act. Since there was the denial for development plan amendment. For Mr. Edie 20 25 dash. Oh, too. Under the planning act. Council must pass a resolution. Okay. So council wants to add to what our reason is. They're getting rid of prime agriculture land. Okay. And I think another point that you had was that it wasn't directly connected to. To and women lands. Yeah. Okay. We could maybe have a five minute recess for this last item calling. And I can draft quickly a resolution to encompass those matters. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Okay. There's no items for closed meetings. So we can adjourn. Or do we keep it open to your done that? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Get ahead of myself again. Okay. Okay. And then I had to myself again. Meeting back to order here. We're going to read out the resolution for. What was the one there. Development Plan amendment by a lot of 20 502. I'm going to reserve to employment for streeting for Wayne Ed. You got I can do that. Move her is Melinda seconder Andy. Beer is all that council has rejected development plan amendment by a lot of 2502 as the proposal is not consistent with agricultural preserve area policy 4.1 which states the protection of prime agricultural land. And the employment opportunity should be located adjacent to her within the designated employment areas. Therefore, be it resolved that council not proceed with by law 2502. So I get a move motion in favor. Carried. And meeting adjourned. Thank you everybody for coming out.

Plan director, Dan. I'll get you done with yourself, please. First item on the agenda is a request for a letter of concurrence from a communication tower. Company, SLI towers. They have followed the protocol under the I said requirements. The reports were provided to council. They want to install a. 213 put self supporting engineered tower within the northeast quarter of nine, ten four. This is just along the south perimeter perimeter highway. The communications, sorry, because communications and wireless service are federally regulated.

They provided a 30 day notification period, which was done through local at news paper ads. And also have sent out circulation to the surrounding landowners. We have not received any comments, any concerns or objections on this tower. And if council were to consider this application, there was a resolution that was drafted for consideration. Thank you. Is there any questions from council for Dan? You know, ask that's we move that the for the concurrence of the letter. Your mover. Andy and Mark. Now, therefore, be resolved that the development officer be authorized to provide the required correspondence relating to the letter of concurrence for the construction of a new wireless communications installation. At 55108 Dawson Road within the northeast quarter nine ten four east. Okay, so we get a motion to our, no, we have the motion, sorry. Can get a vote to in in favor. All improved. Move. Go on to five point two planning development plan amendment by loft 2502 agriculture preserve to employment. I'll get down to read the planning. We have. By law 2502 this is the first reading of a development plan amendment. The first reading of the foundation was made by Mr Wayne 80 of ED farms limited. The development plan is to re designate the property being the southeast quarter of 36104. Excluding the power transmission line plan 7753 for this land being redesign. I have a cultural preserve area to to employment land. The applicant is seeking to re designate the quarter section being 155 acres for industrial purposes. Mr. ED intends to subdivide approximately 20 acres of land for an industrial parcel, the proposed development. There has been no conceptual plans submitted only a rough site plan of severing off the first 20 acres. I provided to council the report in within the report under section 4.1 some of the agricultural policies under the development plan. This land is currently predominantly. The soil classifications are class three with some class two soils within the area. It's not immediately adjacent to existing employment land. There is a about a half mile of agricultural preserve between the two between the the parcel and the other employment lands the existing designation. So if council were to consider this if council were to consider the following development plan amendment. I offer the following resolution to be motion for council for discussion and consideration. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions from council. Mark. Thank you Mr. Deputy Mayor. So my first question of course would be to the development. Planning officer in terms of re designating this land. Does that take away from the thrust of preserving our obviously agricultural land. In other words, is it being farm predominantly now? You indicated of course the classes of soils and how would those soils be protected if we do support this proposal. The lands are currently being cultivated correct. They are a high class of soil capacity. One way to I guess protect the actual physical soil on top is to strip the land and then preserve it later on. I could foresee when this get circular if council grants first first reading. Then we have to circulate it to the provincial departments. I believe department of agriculture will be opposed to this. Excellent and do you know what the proponent plans to do without I know it's redesign it perhaps is industrial or so forth. But is it to put some sort of factories or other buildings steel frame buildings like is there any detail to what the intent is going forward. On the total 155 acre parcel. No one for the residual on the 20 acre parcel out of the 155. I had some preliminary discussions of the industrial building going on there that needed high capacity. Hydral power for that type of business. And that was one of the reasons they had selected this location. So I'm certainly for economic development particularly for our M. Again, I think the province will buy in into the second stage of it in terms of how we preserve that soil with their piece pulling it away or what not. That's kind of the safeguard isn't it going forward. That the province the next step would be having the province review this file. Yes, putting conditions potentially on it. So the province will circulate it to the various agencies will get comments back from those agencies and then will present it to council. Great, thank you for your information. The applicant is in the gallery if council did have any questions strictly for the applicant again, it's not a public hearing for the public but if council has questions from a street. Anybody next to I have I have just a couple questions here like this parcel of land. When I look at it and I and I it's a mile from highway 207 and a mile from highway 15 if I'm not mistaken. And it's in the middle of farming culture. And when you if you're going to start employment in the middle of. I'm going to say this very nicely in the middle of a farm area. What are you looking for for the future because we have a development plan that has certain areas of this municipality for certain employment industrial. And we want to we always talk about preserving our agricultural land. And I guess I'm. I sit there as a as a counselor but I also sit there as a resident knowing that. Yes, I had I have a business next to me. So if I'm on a five acre 10 acre. I don't really want employment next to me. Which I have currently. So you got to look at. Where it's located. What the development plan kind of says for like you don't want to have that over here that over there that over there that over there you need it. In certain areas. That's just my comment on that like. Yeah, okay. Anybody else mark and I would be consistent to what councilor Warren says, but maybe the development officer can can chime in on this or the applicant as you say is here. Maybe they can give their perspective if it's allowed. If if council wants my opinion sure. We are leapfrogging existing development. We are on primary agricultural land. I'm not going to I don't think it's it's a great location for this type of business right there. There are other lands nearby. And we could do a detailed analysis for council when it comes to the public hearing. This is just to bring it on the table as Mr. Ede had made the application. Go ahead. And Mr. Deputy Mayor are we allowed in to have the applicant because I would like to hear perhaps his perspective just to give us some insight to before. Yeah, I agree. I was just going to ask the applicant to come up and speak if he wishes. Wayne. Good evening, counselors. I'm Wayne Edie from ED farms on the owner of the property. No one who's making the application. First of all, all the clarifying location location is on south wind road. One half mile east of 207. And it would be also be that would make it one half mile west of fine redrowed. It butts right up against the existing high roll yard where they store their towers. Yeah, so it's not out in the center of a. Of a quarter section per se. It's but it right against some land that is already used for industrial. Yeah, reason for the application to put it there is because. The intended site is to be used for what's called the data center. Now, a data center needs a large large amount of hydro electricity power to run. And the. A possible purchaser has got an application into the manateau. And so to see how much power the hydro will give them. But that's being the main reason for wanting to be where they're at. Now, as for anyone nearby, there is no houses or anything within a half a mile in any direction of this. Like I say, it's but it right up against high rows existing. Yard yard site. That's the location of it. So Wayne, I have a question to that certainly. Looking at the map and I kind of am familiar with you. Seven there that yard there is more of I think there is a building on that yard that you're saying, but it's not zone employment lands. Then that piece that hydro owns and is that what we're saying. No, from what I understand, it never was changed over when I had high real put their yards out there. They've kind of got a little bit of a special agreement, I guess, that you would say. No, so maybe Dan could fit in on that. Yeah, and if you could clarify that for us. There's no special agreement. What it is is. Sorry, I'm getting echo. The Manitoba Hydro Act over. What's the word I'm looking for? Super seeds the planning act. So Hydro can go anywhere. They can establish any any yard site, any infrastructure facility without complying with zoning. They are established in agricultural zones industrial zones. These were just zones that were or designations we had done with the development plan to recognize a water treatment plan. And then they expanded further to the east where they have a bit of a storage yard for their cable, which is kind of that. You can see it in the aerial photo, but a little faint. There's an old gravel pad between 207 and the half mile off-suffin. Thank you. It comes with any other questions. Go ahead, Andy. Hi, Manitoba. Hi, Manitoba. So how much long this business going to take it from this. What they're looking for initially is 20 acres and the reason for 20 acres, they're going to use 10 acres for the building plus parking. And then they want to use you know, other remaining 10 acres for green space. So they're after 20 acres. For the for the start. Now the reason for applying for the whole quarter section is there's a spin off of a data center. And one of it is they produce a large amount of heat, which they need to disperse. So what they're looking at is partnering up with the agriculture producer, IE someone who's in the greenhouse business. And they can heat these greenhouses from the excess heat from the data center. So that's the reason for pointing up the data center. Well, first of all, you need to pony up the data center next to the hydro because they need an extremely amount of reliable power. And then the phase two, if you want to call it that, is greenhouses and agricultural facilities right next to the data center that can use the excess heat that they just have. And then the excess heat that they generate. That's the reason and you know, thinking outside the blocks for future development, that's why I'd like to sub or rezone the whole 155 acres. And if you look at it on the map, which stands been doing it is quite isolated. It's really in the middle of of other farmland that's owned by Manitoba hydro and everything else around that. So it's not like we're pointing up next to residential houses this is anyway. I do have some information on the data center that I brought the felt you made in water, know about IE, amount of water they use and, you know, the noise from the fans it'll be cooling the facility. I've got all that and they also've got a couple of developers that would cut gladly come down and give you a full presentation and what's involved in the data center. So my next question did you go and talk with neighbors that in the area like he said, I have not yet because we've not got to that step, but like I say there really isn't any neighbors per se within a half a mile. I know them all personally, I gladly talked them before, you know, this gets any further along. I can't see any objection Andy if that's the thinking, but they'll definitely talk to them before. Deepened out there, far more than that's there, you know, the landowners that we should say, yeah, well, the landowners immediately to this south. There's a three quarters of a section actually a whole section, which I lease from hydro hydro actually owns that property and the everything to the north. I own that property for the next two miles and if you go to the east and south there's another section there and I own that one as well. And as well as on the next section over there's another quarter section that's owned by hydro and I lease that as well. So really we're locating this in that area for that reason because it's really open the middle of nowhere. And there's not a lot of, you know, any light pollution anything like that, it won't matter because hydro's right next to them and they've got there or yard sight lit and up as you've probably noticed. But the main reason to put it there is because of the large amount of electricity that they're going to be using to run this situation. And that's the reason for my application for the zoning change. And really we are budding right up against employment land like I say the hydro yard is right there they may not be zoned employment, but they're right there. Thank you. Thank you. Question for the planning officer that's just one title there on that 155 acres. The there's one title. But the one title includes the southern quarter and the northern quarter. So you have so it's the whole east half that is the titled property. Mysteries only making application on the southern portion of that title property. Thank you Mister deputy mayor so just a question because you would probably had the answer. And sounds like crypto currency which is which is generally. No, that's about yeah. So that doesn't matter the question is, would you be opposed to them stripping off what is their eight inches of soil. None whatsoever. No, it's actually should be recommended take the top so the way save the top so early and back fill it was filling our location to the city of Winnipeg. They'll have a pretty easy way of getting filled all back in and you need to build up the level a little bit anyway to. Another thing that with this site it's got perfect drainage the big ditch is right there on the other side of south win road. So you can drain it to the south street in the south way road win road it fires into the slightly it's not going to get. Planned out in the middle of the section somewhere. I just say absolutely and you're no stranger to this and I know there's value to that top soil as well whether you sell it to. Yes. If they want to strip it off, I'll give them a place to put it. Great next door fantastic. Thank you. Okay, any other questions? No thanks. Wait no, thanks. Okay, if I can get a motion on the floor. For the. Uh, bar transmission line from agriculture preserve area to employment. A mover. Sorry. Andy second by. Linda. Sorry. Beer is all that first reading. Be given to buy law number 2502 being a bylaw of the arm a springfield to redesignate all those lands within the southeast quarter 36104. Excluding power transmission line plan 7753 from agricultural preserve area to employment as shown on appendix A. So if I can get a vote on in favor. And against. So it's two to defeated. Thank you. Now we're going to 5.3 proposal to subdivide. Hazel Ridge Road property boundary realignment. If I get down to read. This is an application for first for subdivision, which is a non public hearing item. Uh, we have subdivision application 4189 2478 04 applicants Mr. P busy. Uh, the intent is to subdivide the existing yard site of 7.48 acres from a 68 or parcel. And then consolidating the remaining with the adjacent adiaker holding to create the following the yard site, which would be 7.48 acres and the residual would be 132.5 two acres. Uh, under the zoning bylaw, it falls under the AG agricultural general zoning district. Um, under the development plan, it's an agricultural preserve area. There are two parcels of land that have a total. Uh, acreage of approximately 140 acres under the two title numbers. Uh, the northern 68 or property contains the yard site. This southern 88 or parcel is currently vacant and is under. Uh, crop production. The applicant intends to separate the yard site for retiring purposes from the 68 or parcel. Then consolidate it with the adjacent 88 or holding to form one title for the residual land. The subdiv, the subdivided yard site is defined by an existing shelter belt contains a single family dwelling. Uh, ex and accessory buildings that the dwelling is serviced by a private well and a septic field and septic tank. Uh, the yard site has an existing drive where approach off a hazel red road. The new residential are sorry, the new residual area is vacant, but a but's hazel red road to the north, uh, which will utilize an existing access within the northwest corner of the residual bot. No new titles are being created with this subdivision. Uh, provide a council with under the development plan policy statements and also within the zoning bylaw. It was circulated to various government agencies, Manitoba land titles, Taranette requires a plan. Subdivision, Manitoba agriculture is expressed concerns with the proposed subdivision. There are already two residential lots within the quarter of the maximum allowed under policy for. One, F of the development plan, they recommend that a condition condition of approval, that a development agreement shall be entered into with the municipality. To prevent any additional residential lots on the residual lot. Other agencies. Responded with no comments or concerns. The main branch also speaks about the consideration from Department of Agriculture and they had provided. One condition to enter into a development agreement for the residual lot and for no further residential dwellings public works. And our water and waste department had no concerns either since there's no utility or. Automated carts service. Council has four options council made deny the subdivision council made defer the subdivision council may approve the subdivision without conditions. The subdivision can be considered under policy for one seven and four four one a of the development plan. If council considers approval of the subdivision application, I would recommend the following three conditions number one. The payment of the requisite fees as set up by the current municipal fee by law. Number two that a development agreement be entered into with the municipality regarding the restriction of any construction or placement of a residential dwelling on the residual lot. And number three that the public works. Department will require a digital copy of the subdivision if approved. Georeference then in auto cad civil 3D 2010 or more recent format. Thank you deputy mayor fuel. Any questions from council. No questions is the applicant in here. Hi, do you have anything to add. Okay, yeah, okay sounds good. Okay, if I can get the.

I get a vote in favor. Carried. Move to 6.3 development plan amendment by law 2411 agriculture preserve to employment second reading order side developments on that over to Dan for the planning report. Thank you. We have Mr. Bill McGarry, a president of Waterside Development Corp owner of the property has made an application for a development plan amendment for a lot 134 plan 33 within the south west quarter of 29 at 104 the applicant seeks to re designate the property from agricultural preserve to employment. Mr. McGarry intends to subdivide the approximate 17.4 acres to create additional industrial lots including an internal municipal road. No conceptual plans were provided as of yet with this application. The subject property is currently designated agricultural preserve area under the development plan 18-09. I have submitted sections of the agricultural preserve policies as well as the employment. Some map of the employment of what's existing to the north there is the existing employment land of Waterside development to the south is land owned by the Department of Highways being the TransCanada Highway and to the west is some land that is owned by the railway. To the east there is a small portion of agricultural preserve land adjacent to this proposed site. The bylaw was circulated to various departments agencies surrounding municipalities and planning districts. At the time of the report was written we had received no letters of objections. We received we've only received the comments from the city of Winnipeg which were part of the provincial comments. The provincial comments were referred to the various agencies, mandatory agriculture indicated that while this is an existing small holding being 17.4 acres. It reflects a loss of primary agricultural land and it is unclear of its redesignation is necessary at this point given the large amount of vacant employment land directly adjacent to the parcel in question. Manitoba agriculture expressed concerns from any agricultural perspective any commercial industrial should be directed to those areas currently designated. The employment before expanding new areas but please note that Manitoba agriculture did not formally object. Manitoba infrastructure stated that in response to an email dated November 25th 2024 we have reviewed the above. The government plan amendment the intent is to redesign that the subject site from agricultural preserve area to employment area in order to accommodate future commercial and or industrial development. The plan being redesignated has frontage along Plesy based on all available information we do not object this amendment. I will not continue with the rest of their paragraph. It was provided to council and also on the municipal website. City want to pay had comments regarding land drainage they wanted to as a subject site will be draining onto the city want to pay land drainage infrastructure as the water travels from east to west. They would want a condition for any future development that they need to submit a comprehensive land drainage technical memorandum prepared by a qualified municipal engineer to the satisfaction to the water and waste department. Which talks about rainfall events of 525 and 100 year events. Those would normally be placed as a condition within a subdivision application not necessarily a development plan amendment. With their traffic division would also like a traffic impact study for any future developments if this were to expand in the future and again that would be a condition of a subdivision and not necessarily a development plan amendment. The following departments and agencies either had no concerns or no comments to the cementment being the lands and planning branch the mines branch. My is back now, I know about example it was a semester County website. That I also asked you, I also asked children for a cell and someoneGAN tofed specifically to start a ground, a baby and animal supplement letter. I, I walk into a session for a week on and on I report the support education I told him about this and on a day time, most of the \u0646 businesses celebrated as their native IDA podcast. with the land use policies and the provincial planning regulation, community planning recommends that council give giving considerations of any objections received at the public hearing. So basically they had no objection to this proposal being community planning. If council were to consider this development plan amount, I would offer the following resolution to be discussed and considered by council. Thank you Deputy Mayor Fjol. Thank you. Is the applicant here? Would you like to add anything to that? You come up and state your name. I'm Bob Doolin and I'm with the applicant. Good. Am I too late to postpone this matter until next month? The reason being I contacted Matt O'Bagger Procholes morning by email, I wrote a letter with concerns asked for some data on the net loss of farmland, as the result of burden expansion. She hasn't ever responded and I think her letter is important. Council. Do you have anything to add to this asking too defer it? Until next month. Yeah, I understand that. I have no problem with him deferring, especially if it's different. Why should I receive reply from her? I'll pass it on to Dan. Okay. I'll vote on that deferred. Thank you. Go ahead Dan. With the deferral, we will have to re-enortify when it comes back to the end of the year. When the additional information comes back, we're going to have to repost everything. The circulation within the newspaper, posting it on the property and the surrounding landowners. But there are requirements under the act for timelines. So might not go to the February meeting, it might go to the March meeting. So just be aware of that. Okay. I'll be able to verify with the development officer if Council states the date and time now. Do you still have to do the advertising? No, we don't. Okay. But we don't know when the literature is going to come in. That's the challenge. Okay. Thank you. As you that's our last item. Excuse me, did it? I'm going to be aware. Under the planning act, since there was the denial for development plan amendment. For Mr. Edy 2025-02, under the planning act, council must pass a resolution, stating a reason of the rejection. Okay. So council wants to add to what our reason is. They're getting rid of prime agriculture land. Okay. And I think another point that you had was that it wasn't directly connected to to end-point land. Yeah. Okay. We could maybe have a five-minute recess for this last item, calling an I can draft quickly a resolution to encompass those matters. Yeah. Okay. There's no items for closed meetings. So we can adjourn. Or do we keep it open to your done that? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And ahead of myself again. Okay. Being back to order here. We're going to read out the resolution for, um, what was the one there. Development Plan amendment by a lot of 20502. I could have also reserved to employment for reading for a way to eat. Yeah. I can do that. Move her is Melinda seconder, Andy. Yeah. The resolution for the council has rejected development plan amendment by a lot of 2502 as the proposal is not consistent with the agricultural preserve area policy 4.1, which states the protection of prime agricultural land. And the employment opportunity should be located adjacent to her within the designated employment areas. Therefore, be it resolved that council not proceed with by a lot of 2502. So I get a move motion in favor. Carried. And meeting adjourned. Thank you everybody for coming out.", "summary": "**Part 1 Summary:**\n Okay, having said it six o'clock, I call this meeting order.

I am excited to get our organizational meeting going. It's March 3rd, at 10.50 a.m. I hope to be out of here before lunch. Hi. I'm Bert Packett. I'm glad to meet you in person. We've had a lot of correspondence, but this is the first real meeting. Hi. I'm Amy Johnson. I've met Joe, but haven't met Bert or Zach. Pleased to be here. Hi. I'm Zach Kerry. No relation to John Kerry. I'm pleased to be here. Who would like to take minutes? I will. Thanks. The first order of business is our name. By the way, I am calling the meeting to order. Since we are a software development company, I'm thinking of the softies incorporated. Hold on a minute. I can't go with that. We are a business company, not a diaper manufacturer. How about manager soft incorporated? Sounds good to me. I move that we name our company manager soft, Inc. I second the motion. Any discussion? Good name. Okay, all in favor say aye. Aye. I'll ask if anyone objects. If nobody does, the motion carries. Now we need to elect a board of directors. Since all of us were promoters and really believe in this project, I move that all of us become directors. I agree, but don't we need an odd number? What if we are split 50-50? I nominate my friend with Fred Humbert to be on the board. She is a noted software developer and very nice. I will amend the motion to include her. I'm sure she is great, but I think that we need to talk to her about it and see her resume. I make a substitute amendment that we nominate the four of us, but leave one opening. Okay, I accept the substitute amendment and second the motion with that amendment. I'll contact Winnie. Okay, I don't think there is more discussion. If there is, raise your hand. Using no hands, I'll call the question. Any opposed? None. The motion carries, now we need some officers. Would anyone like to be president? How about you, Joe? You've done a great job organizing this company so far. I would be willing to be vice president. I can be recording secretary. I would be happy to be treasurer and handle the accounts. Okay, so I move that I be president. Amy is VP, Zach is recording secretary and Bert is treasurer. I second the motion. Any discussion? Seeing none, I call the question. All opposed say nay, hearing none, the motion carries. Congratulations officers. Now, what else? I make a motion to approve of our finances. I've arranged for an account at Chase Bank, subject to our name and approval. I second the motion, with an amendment that all expenses over $10,000 have a second signature. That will ensure that we have good oversight. Great idea, Amy. We wouldn't want to get anyone blamed for wasting money or embezzlement. Looking at our books, we do have quite a number of pre-incorporation subscriptions, so we will have money. That's a great idea. Any other discussion? Not from me. Me neither. Okay, the motion carries. What's next? I think we need to approve pre-incorporation contracts. Has anyone signed any contracts, or are we still in discussion stages? I signed a contract for office space last week. I would like that approved. I am working on a contract for software development, but haven't signed anything. I move that we approve all pre-incorporation contracts. I wouldn't want Amy to get stuck. Okay, I'll second the motion. Any other discussion? Seeing none, I'll call the question. Any opposed? Nobody opposed. Motion carries. Great popcorn, Joe. Where did you get it? I also move that we approve pre-incorporation stock subscriptions. We have quite a few, mostly friends and family. I see you ordered lunch. I love the popcorn too, just not in the mood. Yes, I second the motion. I second the motion. All opposed, let me know. Seeing none, the motion carries. Now on to something more serious. I move that we issue stock. We should have two classes, one for the founders, like Google Dose, and one for everyone else. Classic could be common stock, 10,000 shares for $1 each, with one vote. Class B could be preferred stock, 5,000 shares at $10 each, with 15 votes per share. I like that idea. I'm getting all of this down. That means that the most votes for common stock would be 10,000, and the most votes for preferred stock would be 75,000. Okay, I think that was a motion. Any one second the motion? I second the motion. Okay, I call the question. Any opposed? Hearing none, the motion carries. Do we need to do anything else? We need to approve of the articles of incorporation. I've just done them and we'll print them out. Here you go, just got them off the printer. These look good, Zach. I move that we approve the articles of incorporation. I've reviewed them and they look fine. Looks good to me, too. Any opposed? This looks great. I don't think we have anything we need to do today. We need to draft bylaws. We should set another meeting. How about next Thursday at 9? Great job, everyone. See you next week. Meeting is adjourned. Zach, we'll look forward to reading your minutes. Amy, can you ask your paralegal to start a new corporate binder? Thanks, everyone. See you next week. Thanks for joining us.", "summary": "Hi. Who would like to take minutes? I will.

And we don't have, we don't follow a procedure that delegation is supposed to have presentation to the council five days before the presentation. Did we receive that? I don't know. So this is information that Council has heard and Council requested this delegation at this meeting. So there's no attachment. It's a verbal update. Okay. I thought our procedures, we should have the number of delegations and should be, you know, written presentation to it. Attached. If this was out of the blue, but we've already been. This is our last update there that we've already discussed this. This isn't something that's totally new to us. We're just going to have an update.

I just wanted to kind of greet the council on a purchase that we have identified in this year's sleep capital budget. If council remembers we did talk about a asphalt. We're going to be a little bit of a background on this. So since since the last time we talked, I've put a report to you, which will be coming to council for approval. The next council meeting. But see if you have a little bit of background on this. So when we talk about asphalt repair hot box, it's. It's basically a box that you, a trailer that you pull behind. I mean, the vehicle that has asphalt in it could be recycled asphalt. It could be cold mixed asphalt. It could be hot mixed asphalt. So the that purposes of this is to try to get away from. Using some of the heavy duty expenses contracts for a batteries that you see out there and those big trucks in the highways. Give us the opportunity to be seasonal with this, which is one of the biggest benefits. So we don't have to wait for asphalt lines. So we've been or contract your availability. Certainly reduces our costs overall. And again, I was able to be completely mobile. We can have stored asphalt in the winter time that. You put into the hot box that night before and the next morning as a pizza. The next morning your your asphalt is hot ready to go. We reduce waste this way when you go to buy hot nicks in the back of a. You know, 10 in truck for you to enter the day and you got a yard to last over what you do with it. So in this case here, these hot boxes will allow you to. Reheat and reuse your your. Newly bought or your recycled asphalt that's your that's your. So. Something that benefits. In the hot box, it's it'll all day long ago, maintain that heat. So. You can imagine you go pick up asphalt in the morning. Well, within a couple hours, we don't use it all. It's going to be. It's going to be cool. It's not going to be a viable. Pat, this should so. He says that opportunity for that heat retention. And reduces the downtime keeping that asphalt off right. We have to go back and get to get more. So that's fewer trips. So that's a cost savings rate there. We talked a higher to fitment. We're upwards of $400 for our. It for a. It's a very patch. So again, we will definitely minimize the cost there as. And by minimizing the waste having to dump that old asphalt. And then they. We'll have more consistent temperatures throughout today. So we can start in the morning. And three, five, and you have to have temperatures still going to be hot. It's a gets cold overnight. We keep it plugged in. It works on a timer and you set the temperature to which need. Is it electric, I blame this of all these of powered diesel and propane. So. And we got a couple different options there, but the main, the main box of keepsy that houses the asphalt is. These are powered. So yeah, we talked to the season all year round. Availability. And you know, with less trips going back and forth to these plants. And we reduced that carbon footprint to not having to put more miles on vehicles. And so it's all we can contain most everything within our own. You know, take so. We did we didn't look at a few different. Trailer's three in particular. We were at our trace of last year. We were absolutely able to physically touch these things go through. We were able to actually operate on their travel, but. You know, being able to talk to the manufacturers, the users of these. Was was certainly beneficial. So we did from there. We did all our research on the floor and. You know, through their websites and what have you. So we narrowed it down to one that we thought would be the most advantageous for us. And on that, we were actually able to go see this. We're going to be able to go through the different demo. Couple three weeks ago. We went down to. Trace hole in a demo days in Edmonton. And you know, we were very, very pleased that we did. We've got to see that plus some other. Related equipment. So. The recommendation coming forward to council next week will be for the. For the purchase of its through KM international. That is the. That is the manufacturer sold by IMI so international machine incorporated for us. Edmonton. A couple of damages of this one over some of the other ones. There's a bunch of additional safety. Whether it's lighting there's. It may be hard to. Maybe hard to explain without seeing them, but ergonomic. Open it up the big doors and what have you. It makes a big difference. This one allows it's the only one that has two shoots of the home to back. So your box actually chills and it'll tilt on a more more degree than most of the other boxes. So can allow him because it's got two shoots you're allowed to have two guys working there and started just one guy. So you get actually to even have to. Different type of material in the second hopper. So this also comes with a. And infrared. Recyclic the 72 inch. What is a 60 by 72 inch and night. What it is if you have this test with a. Our impairment on the on the asphalt it's all alligator that maybe. Give it a note. But to do this. You roll this machine over it's propane it he's for about 50 minutes. Rejuvenate set. Reheat set asphalt. And then you can break that back into a new asphalt now you get your asphalt trailer repair to you. The shovel a little bit more on there. You compact it and the way you go on that patch you don't dig in a note. You don't have under me you excavate nothing so. So that was another huge advantage of this one where it allows you to carry that infrared. Unit as part of the the trailer and part of the deal. So some of the other ones are there. You can get them but it's as easy to learn the. And then you can get them to the next week. So that's a little bit of the background on. Our new requests for asphalt top box trailer. And then report will come to council next week so it's not. And it's not getting 20 today if there's any additional questions. The council may have. Grand first. Question I have is what size of box or what it how much material. So that would be is it be in four time. Oh, it's four time trailer so we don't have to haul four time on a time. But we certainly can. And a cost. Well our budget was one 150 five. Hundreds of $5,000 in the budgets so we're. We'll be under that price with shipping and that also comes with training as well. They actually come down here and they'll. Training that's staff to use the property safely. Okay. Thank you. Andy. I'll like to ask you a couple questions. So how do you depreparation for the laying the asphalt in that. On the ground. So typically. What's this all have as part of a two. It's a simple tool. So basically at least lower high power at least lower. So it's that happens to be the barrier. It's something wet we can we can blow it out. We also have an external torch at the back of the trailer that we can turn on and and heat that whole up to against the trioding of the. That moisture contaminants out of there. He put a tack coat inside which the trailer comes with a small pack. Oil reservoir. And then lay your asphalt over depending on the size of it. There's a it's got electric winch on the trailer that grabs your. You compact factor drops it on the ground for you guys go pack it down put back in the trailer where you go. Yes, I can question. So we buying directly from a money factoring so we're not going to have 10 there's going to different dealers to get the best price possible price or us. So when we were looking at this you know so no we didn't go to an official. Engine was appoint a decision to 260eger and demanding to discount the total \ub098\uc624 cans such a tight run out of credit $ $ 10,000 experts. So we're looking in thisoon autant to say, FT hasn't taken quality of fees and good taxes died. and we're tap unit and the quality of the build based made out of steel tube, there's steel frame construction rather than tubular, it's less resistant to rusting. So that's where we look for, we look more for the quality of this time, it's a specific type of machine. So there's not a whole lot of units out there that are privy to us in the, you know, the North American area. So it's not a question, how are you heating up like these are actually burns and heat up the bucket that the asphalt needs in it? Yeah, essentially that's what it is. So the hot box will have an inner, uh, inner burner on it. That's heated by diesel. So and this one too again, when we look at the quality, it's a single unit that's, you know, 360 and on the bottom where other ones just have the bottom. So we're actually heating, you know, the depth's not just the bottom. So that's all diesel power, diesel heated. What is the cost of the asphalt like how are you going to buy it by torn out of by G. G. So it's good. So it's a good segue into my next, uh, where we would like to see this thing go. So right now we can, in the summertime, we can have a cold mixed in the area where we can just dump it in the night before turn that machine on and it's ready to go with it's definitely not going to worry. We can go down to the asphalt plant and uh, so asphalt tech in the industrial area, again, fill with, fill the hot box up there so you've got hot box or hot pastoral rate of the bad, but as a day goes on, uh, you know, it's your hauling for a time. It's going to allow it. It's going to stay hot all day. We actually have a plant to make molds, or it's just put two by four molds and we'll make bricks of asphalt or off season. So when the asphalt plants are down, we'll have bricks to store it in our dry storage and our cold storage area. And we just throw bricks in in the, in the evening again, turn that thing on them in the morning. You got asphalt in December if you wanted to. But the next future of this is the, the complete cycling of a single legal vote. We'll give you an example. We're doing boys rode, rode, rode, now let's 300 plus meters of asphalt that we pulled out of there. We saved all those tops. We saved all the asphalt out of there and separated it. So down the road, there's another machine that's every cycling through all of your millions or all your old asphalt in there and it breaks it back down heated. Mixed, we got some regeneration material and now you've got your own asphalt instead of again going to have them buy all the time. It doesn't take long to get quite a stock pile of millions or more asphalt. So that would be the future that we're looking at. And there are different specifications for asphalt, like different categories. Well, there's, there is, but I mean, our general road asphalt is not typical for patching these what we would use. We don't, you know, it's whatever they're batching that day. But we, we have can have asphalt in like course like you don't want to drop if it's raining going to be slippery. So you want to add some granule things to it. So you know, it's course on it. Well, the asphalt has that aggregate material that makes up that part of the asphalt. So we would have that that tack on there. Yeah, thank you. I've been, I got a few, are we able to rent it out? Can we make some money off this? Or not using it? Um, we haven't really never gone down that road. We've talked about it, you know, a few times. I think on a piece of equipment of this. Offside on those really be something we'd want to get into without, you have to be properly trained. And I mean, it comes at the whole bunch of other concerns and who's maintaining it for sure. Are they maintaining it? And for our community, we get it back. And all of a sudden, we want to use it. And it's, there's, there's an issue with it. So if it was, you know, a higher increase of equipment, let's say, in some, you know, different machine that's ultra million dollars or something like that. Maybe that's something not, if you are, and it's could jump into it. It's, it's, you know, kind of a seasonal piece of equipment or something that they could share is because of the cost. No, that's understandable. And that's, that's a unique thing there. You're, you're the expert at that. Is this Canadian, the Canadian owned or Mimitan there? IMI is Canadian based. Yeah. Okay. And what about a warranty? The warranty, I believe that, and what's going to five year warranty on the, on the heaters, it has to get back for the breakdown. I don't have to pro-share on the, on the warranty, but I can certainly bring that back for next meeting on the warranty. Sure. And you budgeted already for this for 155 minutes under that. Correct. Okay. What about the holds? I see we hire people to do the, the streets and fill in the cracks with the rubber compound and so on. It's just part of that there is that something that they, you're referring to crack ceiling. So yeah. That's when you have the liminal cracks that are going sticky all over your road. So yeah. That is something we would not want to get into. It is part of, and it's an attainment part of the, the road maintenance, probably even more so something with somewhat potable patching because you've got a potable, you know, a foot diameters, opposed to 20 meters of a crack that your water's getting in there and then the sector and your subgrade. The reason we would probably not get into something like that is it's at least probably six to seven man crew that you need to run in a fraction of a minute. So it's just just too time consuming and too many people for us. So the actual trailer one person offering that we would operate it for two but you could get away with one. Okay. What about the fire seat? If this thing is plugged in at night and the millibrines here maybe it's, I know when they had to do stuff for welding and all that, either job there at deer lodge then you had to have a protocol for fire and so on like that. Is this indoors and you got to plug in it all? No, this would certainly be an outdoor unit only. So we have a certain area that would be okay. It's just a regular 240 volt. So yeah, but we've been making sure that's a way from a building there and such. That makes sense. And what about Barbcus? Can you roast anything in there? If you don't mind the past and smell of asshole, but I should roll on your last. Okay. I got to know what their questions. Anybody else? Was there something else you had to do at all the, you got both the chart out there? Okay. I know that we're going to come back to you Leslie and Bev and Gord there. Can we finish with a fire chief and then put you on the very last? We're not going to be too too long if that's okay. Brian, is there something that you want to discuss with regards to the rehab trailer? You asked y'all earlier. I'm good with that I understand it then, but it also can be Council. Glenn. It's a clap or brain you got a clap twice. What was Blaine muted the whole time? I got to hear the gun. No problem. Once again, thank you Mayor Council and CAO for having me. I'm the fire chief for the Army Springfield. I'm here to talk about the red head trailer that we presently had put in and large. I'm just getting the dates for you. I'm just going to say that I'm going to be a 2624 before going to the Council. I'm just going to say that I'm going to be a 2624 before going to the Council. I'm just going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to be a 2624 before going to the Council. I'm going to say that I'm going to be a 2624 before going to the Council. I'm going to say that I'm going to be a 2624 before going to the Council. I'm going to say that I'm going to be a 2624 before going to the Council. I'm going to say that I'm going to be a 2624 before going to the Council. I asked earlier before I was unmuted. Did you want me to discuss anything further on the re-hout trailer to explain what it is and what it does? I know about it there, Council. Okay, let's west on. This is something a brand that we could have built by the trailer for 25 and then build the guts. I've never attempted that because most of your trailers that are built with an audit, a camper, a recreational vehicle, they're mostly built in the states. So with that, a lot of them use different hardware because of our installations and our and our the way we are climate. They have a bigger wiring harness than the United States would use a smaller wiring harness. So I've seen that from my personal trailer. So at the that the presence there is no company like I mean you can get a dump trailer and a flat deck trailer bait here, but anything enclosed or anything like this. I haven't seen anything because I've been on the worldwide web there and I haven't found a company out there. Okay. Okay, then we'll just wait for your report to me. Yes, we'll wait. What timeline are we looking at? Okay, I'm on that for the last little while now. So I'm hoping that presented next week with you. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. Very last one here is the twenty twenty five board of revision appointments there. Do we need two people calling to that? Yeah, so just for information at this time our twenty twenty five board of revision scheduled for November 14th. We do have a chair that's from the community that's willing to sit on the board. Typically we have two council members as well. Make up that board. So this is just maybe for information at this time and I know a few of you've done it already. So if there's someone that hasn't done it, that might be an option for you to do it this year. She's looking at me. So I'll be one and I guess we could figure out the second later on. So if you slot me in for that, we'll figure out the second one. And I think that'll take care of that there. And then we'll go to our delegation. Or ten minutes late, but the. Gord if you want to be the the first to just introduce yourself and. Good timing, Randy, we were ten minutes behind you. Just got here. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Gordon Damon and I'm serving as the community consultant for Springfield or S. H. I do the place and. I'm going to be the one that's been working on the. And so that's why I'm here to report in first of all, councilor Kaczynski. I apologize for not providing presentation as the CEO. Draper had indicated. This was a follow up in an update to the previous information we provided so there wouldn't be a new presentation, but I can send to you again the power point that you received in the past. And I think that's a new. And I think that's a new. New on this other than just simply continuing to inform council and keeping everyone informed as to what's taking place. Excuse me, not only for not, but it's for the resident because we own the zone so the residents will hear that. Yeah, okay, so just that you're aware of that. So and thank you for asking the question certainly appreciate that. So members of council, your wisdom leadership and direction has been it continues. And the long term common good of the municipality. The general consensus across the country is that Canada is in the midst of housing crisis, it is even more cute at the seniors housing level as over the next 20 years, the age cohort 65 plus will increase insights by nearly 25 percent. addressing seniors housing not only ensures long-term sustainability of municipalities, but also impart addresses housing affordability with many seniors exiting existing homes when moving to seniors housing like doodle place. So it has a dual role of not only ensuring that you are going to provide housing appropriately for seniors in your community, which we've discussed here before the importance of ensuring that we have balanced cohorts of age groups because seniors provide strong roots in the community, but by those seniors leaving their homes, it actually opens up more homes for younger people that are looking for affordable housing. And so that is a positive for for the community as a whole. And to note the integration of a pool only builds a sense of community for residents of doodle place in citizens of spring field as a whole. And anyone that was walking in this afternoon saw that and we saw this flash pad outside and the numerous ways that were outside. And the fact that you know I had to drive five kilometers now are on the street in because they're just filled with bikes. And I think that's wonderful. And that's what builds community. So with that I think of Dr. Martin Luther King who said the time is always right to do what is right. And without any hesitation, use a counselor doing right. And in this challenging time we face related to housing. I want to say thank you. Your leadership again, your wisdom and the direction you've been providing to SHHI is is welcome and so very important. So this is a follow up as I said before from our March meeting when council provided and passed a resolution. A guarantee for SHHI to be able to proceed with the project. And that guarantee provided up to 6.35 million dollars in total for the guarantee related to ensuring that the amount of the project related to fundraising. The million dollars that we're still hoping to acquire from the province related to the pool. And also the additional funding from FCM to allow for as many sweets as possible to be as affordable as possible are there. Now again the reason for the guarantee was to allow us to begin the project now and have time to meet those requirements over time related to those those three items. And council supported that unanimously. And SHHI is deeply, deeply thankful for that. And it just aligns with council, having or the arm of Springfield, having established SHHI as its housing corporation for seniors. So moving in that direction, so positively with your support, it's allowed for us to look at accesses recommendation to achieve the best mortgage framing with CMHC and maintain fault construction start in a three step process. So as we discussed before, we're looking at the MLI program with CMHC and what we have discovered discovered and this is an update to council is that it is considerably better to request the CMHC financing, which has lots of benefits to it once you've completed the project and once you're building his full. And the reason for that is that if you see the CMHC financing in advance of completion and occupancy, CMHC places on additional requirements and restrictions to be able to prove what you're planning to build and what you're planning to occupy actually happens. And so while we're very confident of that. And so as access, CMHC being a Canadian organization, while they're aware of where Manitoba is, they don't have the same level of understanding of Springfield and what's happening with seniors housing in Manitoba. And so access suggested that utilizing the guarantee that what we do is that we set up a reserve account and that that the guarantee amount of the 6.35 million sits in a reserve account and it's secured there to show that the guarantee is in place and that the guarantee can be used basically as leverage to establish a line for construction allows us to begin the construction now with a mortgage from access. And then what happens is that when we're completed the construction project and we have full occupancy, which I may have just informed us that yet another person provided a $1,000 deposit. So we're at 74, couples are more individuals that are looking for the 54 suites that we have. That means that we're already overoccupied for what we're building. Not to mention Randy and Duval the States who has over 100 people waiting on their list. So occupancy is not the concern. It's a matter of us getting started and access who has been really really good to work with suggested let's start with utilizing an access mortgage first doing it conventionally and then moving forward in once construction is complete switching that over to CMHC. Now conventional mortgage works well, but there are a couple of items with the conventional mortgage that makes it a little bit more difficult and challenging related to being able to have this basically having affordable rents or below market rents. So the first thing that we've all shared before with a CMHC mortgage you can use a 50 year amortization, which allows you to pay back the total cost over a 50 year period. A conventional mortgage you have to pay that back over 30 years. So you can appreciate the payments or higher, which means we can't offer as many affordable speeds. That's why we're not wanting to leave it as a conventional mortgage. We'll convert it over to CMHC afterwards. Also with a conventional mortgage we need to be able to have the equity up front, but access is willing to make an exception to that utilizing the guarantee that that guarantee amount is in a reserve account, which you have sufficient reserves for. It's not a concern. Then they'll allow us to proceed on that side. So the guarantee associated with the reserve account creates the opportunity for completion of the design and construction mobilization this fall. And without this support we would be delayed at least until spring of 2025 at best and we'd still be faced with those additional steps that CMHC would require. So in short this leverages the resources of the municipality reasonably and prudently support the support SHAGI, which is the municipality's housing corporation. Excuse me, seated to address CMHC housing. The recommendation of access is consistent with the presentation to council in March. When we had the resolution passed, CMHC financing is still going to take place just that it'll take place at the end of construction rather than before, which will allow us to have 10% of the sweetes affordable. And if we're successful with the FCM funding, we'll actually have 30% of the sweetes marked as affordable and undermarket rents. It also maintains the pool construction and the municipality remains protected. As should the mortgage remain conventional, if all of a sudden we don't stick with CMHC for whatever reason, there's sufficient net revenue in the cash flow to refund the guarantee as we discussed before over time anywhere from 15 to 20 years depending on how quickly, how sufficiently our actual rent amounts are. So that's why we give this range of 15 to 20 years. So the current status just as an update, the completion of the appraisal that's required of which the SHAGI board passed a resolution about a week and a half ago to confirm market value and a review of the rental revenue to make sure that the rents that are being proposed are sustainable in the marketplace is due at the end of next week. The assuming the appraisal report confirms the market value and the proposed rents is being reasonable. The financing package can be completed by the end of July or early August. That means that we would immediately start completion of the design and it also means incredibly exciting that we will actually start marshalling construction in October, which if we start in October that prevents us having to do heating costs during the remaining portion of construction that would happen in from November December of 2025 to about February March of 2026 and the completion of due to the place and the pool will be completed by spring of 2026. Now to achieve these steps as outlined in the guarantee resolution all that remains is for the CAO and the mayor to authorize and execute the documents to move forward. That's within the resolution and so those are the steps ahead but as an additional step of protection for council that authorization will not take place until there's final approval by the SHI board of the access mortgage and any conditions that they have. And so we expect access to how that back to us by the end of July and I've spoken with Leslie as the as the board chair and we'll be calling a meeting for the end of July early August and then the council members who are board members on SHI will then have a chance to review that as well to make sure it's consistent with everything that is here. SHI will prove the mortgage and then at that point CAO and mayor can then proceed with authorization of the documents as outlined in the in the in the resolution. Distress we are in a hopeful and healthy place with continued oversight by SHI of the do-go place bill that which council is represented and has the final authority through members of council who are board members on SHI which ensures sustainable and successful half ahead. So before we open it up for any questions which I'm sure there'll be some I'd ask Leslie to add to share some comments in close. Thank you Gordon. Leslie talks and chair of the board of Springfield Heritage Housing. Thanks Gordon for laying out our very solid business case for the do-go places assisted living residents. I'd like to recognize Bev Zeroson and Randy Williams, the community volunteer members who have been working with us over the past six years to plan the do-go places assisted living residents and I'd also like to recognize the current council members on the board, meritori and counselor Miller and fuel. Some days our community members feel we'd been at this far too long but we never gave up hope because the seniors in our community desperately need this. Along the way we partnered an initiated discussions with Springfield Council to partner with us that materialized with the formation of Springfield Heritage Housing in January 2021, three and a half years ago. Since that time there has been much work and much water under the bridge, surveys, feasibility studies, grant applications, architectural renderings, fundraising, meetings, meetings and more meetings. Here we are five years later and we still not in the ground but we are finally ready. Everything is in place. On March 19th in this chamber and in front of a packed room of seniors council unanimously approved a resolution. It was moved by a counselor Miller and seconded by our counselor Glenn Fuel. It was a unanimous vote to provide SHHI alone guarantee of $6.35 million. In the past in the last month Springfield Heritage Housing, working with Access Credit Union has taken the necessary steps to finalize our business case. And I think it's quite wonderful that Access Credit Union stepped in and said, why don't we just give you the construction financing and you get this project going and then put CMHC in at the end which CMHC actually much prefers. Do the place assisted living residents is now ready to proceed. All the remains to give this project the green light is for the mayor and CAO to inform us that arrangements have been made to place those funds in a secure RM of Springfield account as Gordon has explained. We can't wait any longer. If we don't move forward now, beyond the potential costs increases, we will lose the confidence of the seniors on the way list as well as the general community related to fundraising and volunteers. There is no question that this project is critically needed. Gordon talked about the 74 people on our dual place waiting list. I think there's been six more since our March resolution. And over 100 on the waiting list at dual states, time is running out for many of the people who place their support behind us when we started this journey. Meritarian deputy mayor fuel counselors Miller, Warren and Kaczynski, you are making dual place a reality. You should be very proud of what you were achieving for the community of Springfield. Our community and our seniors are grateful for your support in making it happen. We can't wait to see all of you at a groundbreaking early this fall. It's time to get this done. Thank you. Thank you very much for your presentation, Gordon, Leslie. Questions comments from council? I see none. I'm anxious for this to proceed and I would sign it today. If I could, there, but once all the paperwork is all done, there's no permit. Go Mark. Thank you Mr. Mary. Congratulations to Leslie and Bev Randy Gord. This is a much needed project for our seniors in our community. The question that I have again is, is there any inherent risk to the ratepayers of Springfield with the 6.35 million that will loan guarantee? In other words, what uncertainties may there be or what unpredictable events could happen? The worst case scenario. I want to ensure that our ratepayers are protected with this fantastic positive initiative. Thank you, Councillor Miller. It's a prudent question and an important question, obviously. From a fiscal framing, once we proceed, the largest risk that would be in place is that which is not anticipated that SHAG would need to rely on the full 6.35 million guarantee. The risk then to the municipality at that point is not that the 6.35 million dollars would become a grand in essence from the taxpayers of Springfield to SHAG, but rather what would happen is that it would be paid back over time. Rather than that guarantee being released into years time at the end of construction, it may be delayed at that point by five years or ten years, but it would be refunded because within the business case, the rents are sufficient to be able to service over time repayment of that guarantee. It's still a user pay concept. It's not taxpayer funded. I want to stress that. The only risk to the municipality at that point is that the repayment would take longer than the two years and so it would be at delay, not a default. On top of that during that delay, the municipality would also be within those payments receiving the current interest rate of that time, so they would not be in a lost position related to as if that money was in an account somewhere. What we're basically doing is leveraging the fiscal ability of the municipality to begin now to avoid additional costs down the road, as well as have better leveraging with CMHC. I runically by moving in this direction by having the guarantee along with the reserve account, I think actually reduces the risk of the municipality, if we would have simply waited for CMHC and utilized the guarantee on its own. It's prudent on your part to move forward and overall reduces that risk. So the risk ultimately is not default, but delayed and that the users of the facility will be paying their own way. The taxpayers will not be subsidizing it. That's reassuring and thank you for that answer. I'm satisfied with that. Thank you. The questions from council. Thank you very much. Let's see you, Beth, Randy, go and. Yes, we are not against the proceeding with this project. We just want to protect the taxpayers. If whatever you said, go down the right now, can we put on the paper and then we verify through a legal counsel that gonna be approved and we can proceed with it. I will go with it. So we have to just one thing. We want to protect the right hand. That's what we're asking for. We use issue of the best with the project. Right. No, that's so first of all, as far as a legal review, my suggestion would be that once we receive back the documentation from Access Credit Union, that we would have SHAGIs lawyer review that, which they would because they have to. It's going to be reviewed. If you would prefer that the RM's lawyer review it on top of SHAGIs lawyer and pay double, which is the progative counsel, we can do that, but I wouldn't suggest it because SHAGIs is the municipality because you are the owner of the municipality. And because SHAGIs lawyer David King would have a fiduciary responsibility as well as a liability themselves. If David King says that this is appropriate, then the municipality is protected and if there's an error in this, then the municipality can sue the lawyer. That's basically what it comes down to. So my recommendation, which would have happened regardless, is utilizing David King. But if it's counsel's wish to have a second counsel, the RM's counsel, whoever that is, to do it, you can do that, but it would be paying double. And lawyers are charging $400 an hour. So I would suspect doing that would be another $2500 to $3,000. But that's your progative. All right, and Councillor Kachiski, is it reasonable to have the one lawyer review it? I mean, it's going to be reviewed legally as you requested. It's just a matter of whether it should be two lawyers. Well, we as a council are going to make that decision. And if we go on a higher amount of lawyer, then we absolutely cost the opponent. So $2500 to protect $6.35 million, it's a small penalty for the municipality to pay. So what does my opinion? Yeah, but it's also a delay, too, because they're not going to work unison once one lawyer is done in the other one. So that's going to delay things. This are our lawyer for SH, HHI is working on our behalf. Well, we're so to do to do two lawyers, doesn't make any sense to me when they're both working for us. David King has got all the credentials in the world. I would assume he's past all the other bar and so on. So I wouldn't say having a second lawyer doing this is is prudent money spent. David King's been on the very front of this before, which is weeds in the grass and so on like that. So he's there to protect our our interests. So they have two lawyers. I would say that that would be just a waste of money and a waste of time and time as money. It would delay your correct. I, you know, it would probably be another with lawyers. It's going to be another week, especially during the summer when people are in holidays. But Councillor Cretchensky, are you indicating that you're not confident of David King's review of the documents on behalf of the municipality? I never stayed at that doctor. I just wanted to make better time to protect the right place of this and I can assure you that then what what SHAI will do is that they will indicate in Mr. King's review that it's not only in the interest of SHAI and what is there, but that also at the same time that he provides comment in regards to the guarantee related to the the armistring field. We can add that within the scope and then at that point you have full assurances that the RM is being not only protected but has the ability as as as David's client to be able to have recourse to be able to sue as something goes in the future. So that is that a compromise position that we can utilize and facilitate and he concerns with that? I got none. So what I will do then is that when we prepare and have the documents moved forward on that basis we will ensure that David has that scope or Mr. King has that scope of responsibility. Thank you. All right. Any other questions at all? I see none. Then at this point here if I can ready to adjourn, I'm going to get a move on a seconder for adjournment. Melinda and Andy and we will close at 151 PM. Thank you very much folks.", "summary": "**Part 1 Summary:**\n We're at the RMO Springfield. It's a question period.

So it's that happens to be the barrier. It's going to allow it. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 4 Summary:**\nWe actually have a plant to make molds, or it's just put two by four molds and we'll make bricks of asphalt or off season. Are they maintaining it? And for our community, we get it back. It is part of, and it's an attainment part of the, the road maintenance, probably even more so something with somewhat potable patching because you've got a potable, you know, a foot diameters, opposed to 20 meters of a crack that your water's getting in there and then the sector and your subgrade. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 5 Summary:**\nSo it's just just too time consuming and too many people for us. I'm going to say that I'm going to be a 2624 before going to the Council. Make up that board. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 6 Summary:**\nSo if there's someone that hasn't done it, that might be an option for you to do it this year. So and thank you for asking the question certainly appreciate that. The million dollars that we're still hoping to acquire from the province related to the pool. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 7 Summary:**\nNow again the reason for the guarantee was to allow us to begin the project now and have time to meet those requirements over time related to those those three items. So occupancy is not the concern. So the guarantee associated with the reserve account creates the opportunity for completion of the design and construction mobilization this fall. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 8 Summary:**\nSo in short this leverages the resources of the municipality reasonably and prudently support the support SHAGI, which is the municipality's housing corporation. That means that we would immediately start completion of the design and it also means incredibly exciting that we will actually start marshalling construction in October, which if we start in October that prevents us having to do heating costs during the remaining portion of construction that would happen in from November December of 2025 to about February March of 2026 and the completion of due to the place and the pool will be completed by spring of 2026.

The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 9 Summary:**\nSome days our community members feel we'd been at this far too long but we never gave up hope because the seniors in our community desperately need this. Our community and our seniors are grateful for your support in making it happen. From a fiscal framing, once we proceed, the largest risk that would be in place is that which is not anticipated that SHAG would need to rely on the full 6.35 million guarantee. The transcript covers a meeting discussion with multiple participants.\n\n**Part 10 Summary:**\nRather than that guarantee being released into years time at the end of construction, it may be delayed at that point by five years or ten years, but it would be refunded because within the business case, the rents are sufficient to be able to service over time repayment of that guarantee.

I'm Joseph Smith. Welcome to our organizational meeting of our new corporation. You will meet Amy, Zach Ann Burke, our promoters. This is not a real corporation. This meeting was created for P. illegal 123, a Parallel Eagle class at MATC in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by Attorney Lori Cornglom. Good morning. As you know, I'm Joseph Smith. I am excited to get our organizational meeting going. It's March 3, at 10.50 AM. I hope to be out of here before lunch. Hi. I'm Bert Beckett. I'm glad to meet you in person. We've had a lot of correspondence, but this is the first real meeting. Hi. I'm Amy Johnson. I've met Joe, but haven't met Bert or Zach. Please to be here. Hi. I'm Zach Kerry. No relation to John Kerry. On please to be here. Who would like to take minutes? I will. Thanks. The first order of businesses are named. By the way, I am calling the meeting to order. Since we are a software development company, I'm thinking of the softies incorporated. Hold on a minute. I can't go with that. We are a business company, not a diaper manufacturer. How about manager soft and incorporated? Sounds good to me. I move that we name our company manager soft ink. I succumb the motion. Any discussion? Good name. Okay. All in favor say aye. I. I. I. Okay. Motion carried. We are now known as manager soft incorporated by the way. I think I'm going to do voting by negatives. I'll ask you if anyone objects. If nobody does, the motion carries. Now we need to elect a board of directors. Since all of us were promoters and really believe in this project, I move that all of us become directors. I agree, but no we need a not number. What if we are split 50, 50? I nominate my friend with Fred Humbuk to be on the board. She is a noted software developer and very nice. I will amend the motion to include her. I'm sure she is great, but I think that we need to talk to her about it and see her resume. I make a substitute amendment that we nominate the four of us, but we've won opening. Okay. I accept the substitute amendment and second the motion with letter amendment. I'll contact Winnie. Okay. I don't think there is more discussion. If there is, raise your hand. Seeing no hands, I'll call the question. Any opposed? None. The motion carries. Now we need some officers. Would anyone like to be president? How about you, Joe? You've done a great job organizing this company so far. I would be willing to be vice president. I can be recording secretary. I would be happy to be treasury and handle the accounts. Okay. So I move that I be president. Amy is VP. Zach is recording secretary and bird is treasurer. I second the motion. Any discussion? Seeing none. I call the question. All opposed? Say nay, hearing none. The motion carries. Congratulations officers. Now, what else? I make a motion to approve of our finances. I've arranged for an account at Chase Bank, subject to our name and approval. I succumb the motion with an amendment that all expenses over $10,000 have a second signature. That will ensure that we have good oversight. Great idea, Amy. We wouldn't want to get anyone blamed for wasting money or investment. Looking at our books, we do have quite a number of pre-incorporation subscriptions, so we will have money. That's a great idea. Any other discussion? Not from me. Minither. Minither. Okay, the motion carries. What's next? I think we need to approve pre-incorporation contracts. Has anyone signed any contracts? Or are we still in discussion stages? I signed a contract for office space last week. I would like that approved. I am working on a contract for software development, but haven't signed anything. I move that we approve all pre-incorporation contracts. I wouldn't want Amy to get stuck. Okay, I'll second the motion. Any other discussion? Seeing none, I'll call the question. Any opposed? Nobody opposed. Motion carries. Great popcorn. Joe. Where did you get it? I also move that we approve pre-incorporations, talks of descriptions. We have quite a few, mostly friends and family. I see you ordered lunch. I love the popcorn too, just not in the mood. Yes, I second the motion. I second the motion. All opposed? Let me know. Seeing none, the motion carries. Now onto something more serious. I move that we issue stock. We should have two classes, one for the founders, like Google does, and one for everyone else. Classic could be common stock, 10,000 shares for one dollar each, with one vote. Class we could be preferred stock, $5,000 shares at $10 each, with 15 votes per share. I like the idea. I'm getting all of this down. That means that the most votes for common stock would be $10,000, and the most votes for preferred stock would be $75,000. Okay, I think that was a motion. Any one second the motion? I secone the motion. Okay, I call the question. Any opposed? Hearing none, the motion carries. Do we need to do anything else? We need to approve of the articles of incorporation. I've just done them and will print them out. Here you go, just got them off the printer. These look good, Zach. I move that we approve the articles of incorporation. I've reviewed them and they look fine. Looks good to me too. Any opposed? This looks great. I don't think we have anything we need to do today. We need to draft bylaws. We should set another meeting. How about next Thursday at 9? Great job everyone. See you next week. Meeting is adjourned. Zach, we'll look forward to reading your minutes.

That's one PM on July 9th of 2024. And this is a committee of a whole. My name is Mayor Patrick Terion. For the RMO Springfield. President and chambers is our CEO Colleen Draper. And to my right, in the sending order is a Deputy Mayor and Counselor Ward 1, a Glenn Fuel. Counselor Ward 2 is Andy Kaczynski. Counselor Ward 3, a Mark Miller, is not present. It cannot be present. And the Counselor Ward 4 is Melinda Warren. Then at this point here, we're prepared to call approval of the agenda. Can I get a mover in the second, please? Melinda and Glenn. Any questions? Mayor Andy. Mr. Mayor, I'd like to ask, we have delegation today. And we don't have, we don't follow a procedure that delegation is supposed to have presentation to the council five days before the presentation. Did we receive that? I don't know. So this is information that Council has heard and Council requested this delegation at this meeting. So there's no attachment. It's a verbal update. Okay. I thought our procedures, we should have the number of delegations and should be, you know, written presentation to it. Attached. If this was out of the blue, but we've already been. This is our last update there that we've already discussed this. This isn't something that's totally new to us. We're just going to have an update. Any other questions, comments, if you're approval of the agenda? I see none. Can I get a show hands? Those in the support? That is unanimous. Let's carry it. Excuse me. We get a mover in the second or private before that's approval of the minutes. Patrick and Nemaninda. Any questions? Is it at all with regards to the minutes in July 11th? I see none. Then if I can get a show hands, those in support of passing the approval of the minutes for July or June 11th. As unanimous and as carried. Then item five. It's a question period. Any questions in the audience? I see none. Then online. I don't see any there. So we'll go from a question period to item number six. We're a little bit early, but we're able to do that 12 minutes early. We should probably carry on to new business and then hear the delegation at 15. In case people are attending just for that. Then what do we get to new business? We'll go to 8.1, can I get a show hands at those in support of the new business? I'm Linda and Glenn. Then first one will be fleet purchases. There and I'm thinking that's going to be a blame. You a long time we'll see, Glenn. I'm going to go to the next question. Thank you. I just wanted to kind of greet the council on a purchase that we have identified in this year's sleep capital budget. If council remembers we did talk about a asphalt. We're going to be a little bit of a background on this. So since since the last time we talked, I've put a report to you, which will be coming to council for approval. The next council meeting. But see if you have a little bit of background on this. So when we talk about asphalt repair hot box, it's. It's basically a box that you, a trailer that you pull behind. I mean, the vehicle that has asphalt in it could be recycled asphalt. It could be cold mixed asphalt. It could be hot mixed asphalt. So the that purposes of this is to try to get away from. Using some of the heavy duty expenses contracts for a batteries that you see out there and those big trucks in the highways. Give us the opportunity to be seasonal with this, which is one of the biggest benefits. So we don't have to wait for asphalt lines. So we've been or contract your availability. Certainly reduces our costs overall. And again, I was able to be completely mobile. We can have stored asphalt in the winter time that. You put into the hot box that night before and the next morning as a pizza. The next morning your your asphalt is hot ready to go. We reduce waste this way when you go to buy hot nicks in the back of a. You know, 10 in truck for you to enter the day and you got a yard to last over what you do with it. So in this case here, these hot boxes will allow you to. Reheat and reuse your your. Newly bought or your recycled asphalt that's your that's your. So. Something that benefits. In the hot box, it's it'll all day long ago, maintain that heat. So. You can imagine you go pick up asphalt in the morning. Well, within a couple hours, we don't use it all. It's going to be. It's going to be cool. It's not going to be a viable. Pat, this should so. He says that opportunity for that heat retention. And reduces the downtime keeping that asphalt off right. We have to go back and get to get more. So that's fewer trips. So that's a cost savings rate there. We talked a higher to fitment. We're upwards of $400 for our. It for a. It's a very patch. So again, we will definitely minimize the cost there as. And by minimizing the waste having to dump that old asphalt. And then they. We'll have more consistent temperatures throughout today. So we can start in the morning. And three, five, and you have to have temperatures still going to be hot. It's a gets cold overnight. We keep it plugged in. It works on a timer and you set the temperature to which need. Is it electric, I blame this of all these of powered diesel and propane. So. And we got a couple different options there, but the main, the main box of keepsy that houses the asphalt is. These are powered. So yeah, we talked to the season all year round. Availability. And you know, with less trips going back and forth to these plants. And we reduced that carbon footprint to not having to put more miles on vehicles. And so it's all we can contain most everything within our own. You know, take so. We did we didn't look at a few different. Trailer's three in particular. We were at our trace of last year. We were absolutely able to physically touch these things go through. We were able to take up for them. They were at a trace, but. You know, being able to talk to the manufacturers, the users of these. Was was certainly beneficial. So we did from there. We did all our research on the floor and. You know, through their websites and what have you. So we narrowed it down to one that we thought would be the most advantageous for us. And on that we were actually able to go see this. We've been demo couple three weeks ago. We went down to trace hole in a demo days in Edmonton. And you know, we were very, very pleased that we did. We've got to see that plus some other. Related equipment. So. The recommendation coming forward to council next week will be for the. For the purchase of its through KM international. That is the. That is the manufacturer sold by IMI so international machine incorporated for us. Edmonton. A couple of damages of this one over some of the other ones. There's a bunch of additional safety. Whether it's lighting there's. It may be hard to. Maybe hard to explain without seeing them, but ergonomic. Open it up the big doors and what have you. It makes a big difference. This one allows it's the only one that has two shoots of the home to back. So your box actually chills and it'll tilt on a more more degree than most of the other boxes. So can allow him because it's got two shoots you're allowed to have two guys working there and started just one guy. So you get actually to even have to. Different type of material in the second hopper. So this also comes with a. And infrared. Recyclic the 72 inch. What is a 60 by 72 inch and night. What it is if you have this test with a. Our impairment on the on the asphalt it's all alligator that maybe. Give it a note. But to do this. You roll this machine over it's propane it he's for about 50 minutes. Rejuvenate set. Reheat set asphalt. And then you can break that back into a new asphalt now you get your asphalt trailer repair to you. The shovel a little bit more on there. You compact it and the way you go on that patch you don't dig in a note. You don't have under me you excavate nothing so. So that was another huge advantage of this one where it allows you to carry that infrared. Unit as part of the the trailer and part of the deal. So some of the other ones are there. You can get them but it's as easy to learn the. And then you can get them to the next week. So that's a little bit of the background on. Our new requests for asphalt top box trailer. And then report will come to council next week so it's not. And it's not getting 20 today if there's any additional questions. The council may have. Grand first. Question I have is what size of box or what it how much material. So that would be is it be in four time. Oh, it's four time trailer so we don't have to haul four time on a time. But we certainly can. And a cost. Well our budget was one 150 five. Hundreds of $5,000 in the budgets so we're. We'll be under that price with shipping and that also comes with training as well. They actually come down here and they'll. Training that's staff to use the property safely. Okay. Thank you. Andy. I'll like to ask you a couple questions. So how do you depreparation for the laying the asphalt in that. On the ground. So typically. What's this all have as part of a two. It's a simple tool. So basically at least lower high power at least lower. So it's that happens to be the barrier. It's something wet we can we can blow it out. We also have an external torch at the back of the trailer that we can turn on and and heat that whole up to against the trioding of the. That moisture contaminants out of there. He put a tack coat inside which the trailer comes with a small pack. Oil reservoir. And then lay your asphalt over depending on the size of it. There's a it's got electric winch on the trailer that grabs your. You compact factor drops it on the ground for you guys go pack it down put back in the trailer where you go. Yes, I can question. So we buying directly from a money factoring so we're not going to have 10 there's going to different dealers to get the best price possible price or us. So when we were looking at this you know so no we didn't go to an official. We didn't go to a full location or tender rather we looked at it has best quality and best fit and what was going to suit us. The best for the argument so we weren't facing it on the cheapest machine. I and we didn't want to look at it as buying the cheapest one we wanted to make sure we got the right one and the right fit for what we were looking for. And being that this one in the campuses are pattern and our infrared and we're tapped unit. The quality of the bill based later of. The old two there's still frame. Construction rather than two billion it's less. Resistant to to rustine. So that's where we looked for we looked more for the quality of this time it's a specific type of machine so there's not a whole lot of units out there that are. And we need to us in you know the North American areas so. So another question how are you heating up like these all actually burns and and heat up the the bucket that the asphalt is in it. Yeah essentially that's what it is so the hot box will have an inner. And we're going to turn it on it that's heated by diesel so and this one too again. When we looked at the quality it's a single unit that's you know 360 and on the bottom or other ones just have the bottom so we're actually heating. You know the depth not just the bottom right so that's all these all powered or diesel heated. What is the cost of the asphalt like how are you going to buy it by tongue out of my. And I love this is good so it's a good segue into my next. Where we we would like to see this thing go so right now we can in the summertime we can have a cold mixed in our yard we can just dump it in the night before turn that machine on and it's ready to go with. It's often worried. We can go down to the asphalt plant and so asphalt tech in the industrial area. Again fill with. The hot box up there so you've got hot box or hot past or right off the bed but as a day goes on. You know it's your hauling for a time it's going to be a lot is going to stay hot all day. We we actually have a plan to make molds or it's just put two by four molds and we'll make bricks of asphalt or off season so when the asphalt plants are down. We'll have bricks to store in our. Dry storage in our cold storage area and we just throw bricks in in the in the evening again turn that thing on the morning you got asphalt in December if you want to. But the next. The future of this is the complete recycling of a single legal vote. Give you an example we're doing boys rode over a dollar 300 plus meters of asphalt that we pulled out of there we saved all those tops we saved all the asphalt out of there. And separated it so down the road there's another machine that's every cycle you throw all your millions or all your old asphalt in there. And it breaks it back down heated mix it we've had some regeneration material and now you've got your own asphalt instead of. Again going to have a buy all the time and it doesn't take long to get quit a stock by all of millions or more asphalt so that would be the future that we're looking at. And there are different specifications for asphalt like different categories and. Well, there's there is but in our general road asphalt is not typical for patching is what we would use we don't you know, whatever they're batching that day. But we we have can have asphalt in like course like you the one that. Drop if it's raining going to be slippery so you want to add some granular things to it so you know it's course on it. So yeah well the asphalt has that. I don't get material that makes up that part of the actual so we would have that that tack on there. Yeah, thank you. I got a few are we able to rent it out can we make some money off this or not using it. We haven't really never gone down that road we've talked about it. You know, a few times I think on a piece of equipment of this. I don't know if there really really be something we'd want to get into without. You have to be properly trained and I mean it comes at the whole bunch of other concerns and. Who's maintaining for sure are they maintaining and properly we get it back and all said we want to use it and it's. There's there's an issue with it so if it was you know a higher in piece of group let's say some. There's a different machine that's ultra million dollars or something like that maybe that something that. If you are and it's could jump into it is it's. You know kind of a seasonal piece of equipment or something that they could share is because of the cost but. No that's understandable and that's that's a you think there you're the expert at that. Is this Canadian the Canadian owned for a member to another. I am I is Canadian based yeah. Okay and what about a warranty. I believe that and what's going to five year warranty on the. On the heaters. I'd have to get back for the break down and have to brochure on the warranty but I can certainly bring that back for. Next meeting on the warranty. Sure and you budgeted already for this for 155 minutes under that. Okay. What about the holds I see we hire people to do the. The streets and fill in the cracks with the rubber compound and so on it's just part of that there is that something that the. You're referring to crack ceiling so yeah that's when you have the. Lineal cracks that are going sticky all over your road so yeah. That is something. We would not want to get into it is part of and it's in the table part of the the road maintenance. Probably even more so some somewhat potable patching because you've got a potable you know a foot diameters opposed to. Twenty meters of a crack that your waters getting in there and then set to your sub grade. The reason we would probably not get into something like that is it's at least probably six to seven man crew that you need to run. Practically limited so it's just it's just too time consuming and too many people for us so. The actual trailer one person offering that we would operate it or two but you could get ready. Okay. What about fire seat if this thing is plugged in at night and the balance here maybe it's. I know when they had to do. The stuff for welding and all that either job there at deer lodge then you had to have a protocol for fire and so on like that is this indoors and you got to plugged in and all. No, this would certainly be an outdoor unit only so we have a certain period would be. Okay, and it's just regular 240 volt. So yeah, but we can make sure that's a way from a building there in such. That makes sense and what about Barb you just can you roast anything. If you don't mind the. Based and smell of asshole. Sure. On your last. Okay, I got to know the questions. Anybody else? Was there something else you had to do at all? You got both the. Check it out there. Okay. I know that we we're going to come back to you Leslie and Bev and Gord there. Can we finish with the fire chief and then put you on the very last we're not going to be too too long if that's okay. Brian is there something that you want to discuss with regards to the rehab trailer. You asked all this. I'm good with it. I understand it. Then we also can. Glenn. It's a clap or brain. You got a clap twice. Was. Was. The whole time. Did you. I got to get. Okay, no problem. So once again, thank you. Mayor Council and CAO for having me. I'm the fire chief for the arm springfield. I'm here to talk about the. I'm here to talk about the rehab trailer that we presently had put in and large. I'm just getting the dates for you. The last six twenty twenty four before going in front of council, the cost was forty eight thousand dollars US dollars. On a me 15th from the same company. It was 59,637 doll to US dollars. With that it has gone up significantly. Just to note that there is no company in Canada that actually makes this trailer. I'm not paying enough. I have been a little bit of research on home. I asked earlier before it was unmuted. Did you want me to discuss anything further on the rehab trailer to explain what it is and what it does. council. This is something a brand that we could have build by the trailer for 25 and then build the guts. Never attempted that because most of your trailers that are built with an audit, it's a camper or recreational vehicle. They're mostly built in the states. So with that, I'm a lot of them use different hardware because of our installations and our, the way we are climate, they have a bigger wiring harness than the United States would use a smaller wiring harness. So I've seen that from my personal trailer. So at the, at the presence there is no company like, I mean, you can get a dump trailer and a flat deck trailer bait here, but anything enclosed or anything like this. I haven't seen anything because I've been on the world wide web there and I haven't found a company out there. Okay. Okay, then we'll just wait for your report then I guess that's where we'll wait. What timeline are we looking at? Next week, hopefully. Oh, okay. I'm on that for the last little while now. So I'm hoping that presented next week with you. Okay. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Very last one here is the 2025 board of revision appointments there. Do we need two people calling to that? Yeah. So just for information at this time, our 2025 board of revision scheduled for November 14th. We do have a chair. That's from the community that's willing to sit on the board. Typically, we have two council members as well. Make up that board. So this is just maybe for information at this time and I know a few of you've done it already. So if there's someone that hasn't done it, that might be an option for you to do it this year. She's looking at me. So I'll be one and I guess we could figure out the second later on. So if you slot me in for that, we'll figure out the second one. And I think that'll take care of that there. And then we'll go to our delegation. Or 10 minutes late, but the court, if you want to be the the first to just introduce yourself and Good timing, Randy. We were 10 minutes behind you. You just got here. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Gordon Damon and I'm serving as the community consultant for Springfield. Our SATHI do the place and seconded by the RM. And so that's why I'm here to report in. First of all, Councillor Kaczynski, I apologize for not providing a presentation as the CAO, Draper Ed indicated. This was a follow up and an update to the previous information we provided. So there wouldn't be a new presentation, but I can send to you again the power point that you received in the past. So there's there's nothing new on this other than just simply continuing to inform council and keeping everyone informed as to what's taking place. Excuse me, not only for not, but it's for the resident because we own the zone so the residents will hear that. Yeah, okay, so just that you're aware of that. So and thank you for asking the question certainly appreciate that. Members of council, your wisdom, leadership and direction has been it continues to be critical for the long term common good of the municipality. The general consensus across the country is that Canada is in the midst of a housing crisis. It is even more acute at the seniors housing level as over the next 20 years, the age cohort 65 plus will increase in size by nearly 25%. Addressing seniors housing not only ensures long term sustainability of municipalities, but also imparted dresses housing affordability with many seniors. Exiting existing homes when moving to seniors housing like doodle place. So it has a dual role of not only ensuring that you are going to provide housing appropriately for seniors in your community, which we've discussed here before the importance of ensuring that we have. Balance cohorts of age groups because seniors provide strong roots in the community, but by those seniors leaving their homes, it actually opens up more homes for younger people that are looking for affordable housing. And so that is a positive for for for the community as a whole. And to note the integration of a pool only build a sense of community for residents of doodle place in citizens of springfield as a whole and anyone that was walking in this afternoon saw that and we saw the splash pad outside and the numerous ways that were outside. And the fact that you know I had to drive five kilometers now are on the street in because they're just filled with bikes and I think that's wonderful and that's what builds community. So with that I think of Dr Martin Luther King who said the time is always right to do what is right and without any hesitation use a counselor doing right and in this challenging timely face related to housing. I want to say thank you. Your leadership again your wisdom and the direction you've been providing to S.H.I. is is welcome and and so very important. So this is a follow up as I said before from our March meeting when council provided and passed a resolution. And so we're going to be a little bit more of a good opportunity to be able to proceed with the project and that guarantee provided up to 6.35 million dollars in total for the guarantee related to ensuring that the amount of the project related to fundraising. And so that we're still hoping to acquire from the province related to the pool and also the additional funding from FCM to allow for as many sweets is possible to be as affordable as possible are there. Again, the reason for the guarantee was to allow us to begin the project now and have time to meet those requirements over time related to those those three items and council supported that unanimously and S.H.I. is deeply deeply thankful for that and it just aligns with. Council having or the arm of springfield having established S.H.I. as its housing corporation for seniors so. Moving in that direction so positively with your support it's allowed for us to look at accesses recommendation to achieve. The best mortgage framing with CMHC and maintain fault construction start in a three step process so as we discussed before we're looking at the M.A.I. program with CMHC and what we have discovered discovered and this is an update to council. Is that it is considerably better to request the CMHC financing which has lots of benefits to it once you've completed the project and once you're building his full and the reason for that is that if you see the CMHC financing in advance of completion and occupancy CMHC places on additional requirements and restrictions. To be able to prove what you're planning to build and what you're planning to occupy actually happens and so while we're very confident of that and so as access CMHC being a Canadian organization. While they're aware of where man atoba is they don't have the same level of understanding of springfield and what's happening with seniors housing in Manatoba and so access suggested that utilizing the guarantee that what we do is that we set up a reserve account and that that the guarantee amount of the 6.35 million sits in a reserve account and a secured there to show that the guarantee is in place. And that the guarantee can be used basically as leverage to establish a line of a line for construction allows us to begin the construction now with a mortgage from access and then what happens is that when we're completed the construction project and we have full occupancy which I may add. And we have just informed us that yet another person provided a thousand dollar deposits so we're at 74 couples or individuals that are looking for the 54 suites that we have. And so we're all ready over occupied for what we're building not to mention Randy and do the states who has over a hundred people waiting on their list so occupancy is not the concern. How about we do the takiej return 1900 and zero conversion that he's set up. good to work with suggested let's start with utilizing an access more image first doing it conventionally and then moving forward in once constructions complete switching that over to CMHC. Now conventional mortgage works well but there are a couple of items with the conventional mortgage that makes it a little bit more difficult and challenging related to being able to have this basically having affordable rents or below market rents. So the first thing that we've all shared before with a CMHC mortgage you can use a 50 year amortization which allows you to pay back the total cost over a 50 year period. A conventional mortgage you have to pay that back over 30 years so you can appreciate the payments or higher which means we can't offer as many affordable speeds. That's why we're not wanting to leave it as a conventional mortgage will convert it over to CMHC afterwards. Also with a conventional mortgage we need to be able to have the equity up front but access is willing to make an exception to that utilizing the guarantee that guarantee amount is in a reserve account which you have sufficient reserves for is not a concern then they'll allow us to proceed on that on that side. So the guarantee associated with the reserve account creates the opportunity for completion of the design and construction mobilization this fall. And without this support we would be delayed at least until spring of 2025 at best and we'd still be faced with those additional steps that CMHC would require. So in short this leverages the resources of the municipality reasonably and prudently support the support SHAGI which is the municipality's housing corporation. Excuse me, seated to address senior housing. The recommendation of access is consistent with the presentation to Council in March when we had the resolution passed. CMHC financing is still going to take place just that it'll take place at the end of construction rather than before which will allow us to have 10% of the sweets affordable and if we're successful with the FCM funding we'll actually have 30% of the sweets marked as affordable and undermarket rents. It also maintains the pool construction and the municipality remains protected as should the mortgage remain conventional. With all of a sudden we don't stick with CMHC for whatever reason. There's sufficient net revenue and the cash flow to refund the guarantee as we discussed before over time anywhere from 15 to 20 years depending on how quickly well how sufficiently our our actual rent amounts are so that's why we give this range of 15 to 20 years. So the current status just is an update the completion of the appraisal that's required of which the SHAGI board passed a resolution about a week and a half ago to confirm market value and review of the rental revenue to make sure that the rents that are being proposed are sustainable in the marketplace is due at the end of next week. The assuming that the praisel report confirms the market value and the proposed rents is being reasonable. The financing package can be completed by the end of July or early August. That means that we would immediately start completion of the design and it also means incredibly exciting that we will actually start marshalling construction in October which if we start in October that prevents us having to do heating costs during the remaining portion of construction that would happen in from November December of 2025 to about February March of 2026 and the completion of due to the place and the pool will be completed by spring of 2026. Now to achieve these steps as outlined in the guarantee resolution, all that remains is for the CAO and the mayor to authorize and execute the documents to move forward. That's within the resolution and so those are the steps ahead but as an additional step of protection for council that authorization will not take place until there's final approval by the SHAGI board of the access mortgage and any conditions that they have. So we expect access to how that back to us by the end of July and I've spoken with Leslie as the as the board chair and we'll be calling a meeting for the end of July or early August and then the council members who are board members on SHAGI will then have a chance to review that as well to make sure it's consistent with everything that is here. SHAGI will approve the mortgage and then at that point the CAO and mayor can then proceed with authorization of the documents as outlined in the in the in the resolution. Distress we are in a hopeful and healthy place with continued oversight by SHAGI of the due-go-place bill that which council is represented and has the final authority through members of council who are board members on SHAGI which ensures sustainable and successful half a head. So before we open it up for any questions which I'm sure there'll be some. I'd ask Leslie to share some comments in close. Thank you Gordon. Leslie talks and chair of the board of Springfield Heritage Housing. Thanks Gordon for laying out our very solid business case for the due-go-place assisted living residents. I'd like to recognize Bev Zeroson and Randy Williams the community volunteer members who have been working with us over the past six years to plan the due-go-place assisted living residents and I'd also like to recognize the current council members on the board, meritorion, councilor Miller and fuel. Some days our community members feel we've been at this far too long but we never gave up hope because the seniors in our community desperately need this. Along the way we partnered an initiated discussions with Springfield Council to partner with us that materialized with the formation of Springfield Heritage Housing in January 2021, three and a half years ago. Since that time there has been much work and much water under the bridge, surveys, feasibility studies, grant applications, architectural renderings, fundraising, meetings, meetings and more meetings. Here we are five years later and we still not in the ground but we are finally ready. Everything is in place. On March 19th in this chamber and in front of a packed room of seniors, council unanimously approved a resolution. It was moved by a councilor Miller and seconded by our councilor Glenn Fuel. It was a unanimous vote to provide SHHI a loan guarantee of $6.35 million. In the past in the last month Springfield Heritage Housing, working with Access Credit Union has taken the necessary steps to finalize our business case. And I think it's quite wonderful that Access Credit Union stepped in and said, why don't we just give you the construction financing and you get this project going and then put CMHC in at the end which CMHC actually much prefers. Do the place assisted living residents is now ready to proceed. All the remains to give this project the green light is for the mayor and CAO to inform us that arrangements have been made to place those funds in a secure RM of Springfield account as Gordon has explained. We can't wait any longer. If we don't move forward now, beyond the potential costs increases, we will lose the confidence of the seniors on the wait list as well as the general community related to fundraising and volunteers. There is no question that this project is critically needed. Gordon talked about the 74 people on our Dugel place waiting list. I think there's been six more since our March resolution. And over 100 on the waiting list at Dugel estates, time is running out for many of the people who place their support behind us when we started this journey. Meritarian deputy mayor Fiuou, councillors Miller, Warren and Kaczynski, you are making Dugel place a reality. You should be very proud of what you were achieving for the community of Springfield. Our community and our seniors are grateful for your support in making it happen. We can't wait to see all of you at a groundbreaking early this fall. It's time to get this done. Thank you. Thank you very much for your presentation, Gordon Leslie. Questions comments from council? I see none. I'm anxious for this to proceed and I would sign it today. If I could there, but once all the paperwork is all done, there's no permit. Go, Mark. Thank you, Mr. Mary. Congratulations to Leslie and Beth Randy Gord. This is a much needed project for our seniors in our community. The question that I have again is, is there any inherent risk to the ratepayers of Springfield with the 6.35 million that will loan guarantee? In other words, what uncertainties may there be or what unpredictable events could happen? The worst case scenario. I want to ensure that our ratepayers are protected with this fantastic positive initiative. Thank you, councillor Miller. It's a prudent question and an important question, obviously. From a fiscal framing, once we proceed, the largest risk that would be in place is that which is not anticipated that SHAG would need to rely on the full 6.35 million dollar guarantee. The risk then to the municipality at that point is not that the 6.35 million dollars would become a grant in essence from the taxpayers of Springfield to SHAG. Rather what would happen is that it would be paid back over time. Rather than that guarantee being released into years time at the end of construction, it may be delayed at that point by five years or ten years, but it would be refunded because within the business case, the rents are sufficient to be able to service over time repayment of that guarantee. So it's still a user pay concept. It's not taxpayer funded. I want to stress that the only risk to the municipality at that point is that the repayment would take longer than the two years and so it would be a delay, not a default. And on top of that, during that delay, the municipality would also be within those payments receiving the current interest rate of that time so they would not be in a lost position related to as if that money was in an account somewhere. So what we're basically doing is leveraging the fiscal ability of the municipality to begin now to avoid additional costs down the road, as well as have better leveraging with CMHC. So ironically, by moving in this direction, by having the guarantee along with the reserve account, I think actually reduces the risk of the municipality if we would have simply waited for CMHC and utilized just like the guarantee on its own. It's prudent on your part to move forward and overall reduces that risk. So the risk ultimately is not default, but delayed, and that the users of the facility will be paying their own way. The taxpayers will not be subsidizing it. That's reassuring and thank you for that answer. I'm satisfied with that. Thank you. You have the questions from council? Thank you very much. Let's see you, Bev, Randy, go and. Yes, we are not against the proceeding with this project. We just want to protect the taxpayers. And if whatever you said, go down the right now, can you put on the paper and then we verify through a legal council that gonna be approved and we can proceed with it or go with it? So we have to just one thing. We want to protect the right hand. Yeah, that's all we're asking for. Yeah, but we use wish you all the best with the project. Right. No, that's so first of all, as far as a legal review, my suggestion would be that once we receive back the documentation from access credit union, that we would have SHAGIs lawyer review that, which they would because they have to. It's going to be reviewed. If you would prefer that the RM's lawyer review it on top of SHAGIs lawyer and pay double, which is the progative council, we can do that, but I wouldn't suggest it because SHAGIs the municipality because you are the owner of the municipality and because SHAGIs lawyer David King would have a fiduciary responsibility as well as a liability themselves. If David King says that this is appropriate, then the municipality is protected and if there's an error in this, then the municipality can sue the lawyer. That's basically what it comes down to. So my recommendation, which would have happened regardless, is utilizing David King, but if it's council's wish to have a second council, the RM's council, whoever that is, to do it, you can do that, but it would be paying double. And lawyers are charging $400 an hour. So I would suspect doing that would be another $2,500 to $3,000, but that's your progative. All right, and Councillor Kachiski, is it reasonable to have the one lawyer review it? I mean, it's going to be reviewed legally as you requested. It's just a matter of whether it should be two lawyers. Well, we as a council are going to make that decision. And if we go on the higher amount of lawyer, then we absolutely cost the afforded. So $2,500 to protect $6.35 million, it's a small penalty for putting the back to pay. So what's the final opinion? Yeah, but it's also a delay too, because they're not going to work unison once one of the lawyers done in the other ones. So that's going to delay things. This are our lawyer for SHHHI is working on our behalf. So to do two lawyers, it doesn't make any sense to me when they're both working for us. David King has got all the credentials in the world. I would assume he's he's passed all the other bar and so on. So I wouldn't say having a second lawyer doing this is is prudent money spent. David King's been on the very front of this before, which is weeds in the grass and so on like that. So he's there to protect our our interests. So to have two lawyers, I would say that that would be just a waste of money and a waste of time and time as money. It would delay your correct. I, you know, it would probably be another with lawyers. It's going to be another week, especially during the summer when people are in holidays. But Councillor Cricciansky, are you indicating that you're not confident of David King's review of the documents on behalf of the municipality? I never stated that I just wanted to make better time to protect the right place of this. And I can assure you that then what what SHHHI will do is that they will indicate in Mr. King's review that it's not only in the interest of SHHHI and what is there. But that also at the same time that he provides comment and regards to the guarantee related to the the armistring field. We can add that within the scope. And then at that point you have full assurances that the RM is being not only protected but has the ability as David's client to be able to have recourse to be able to sue something goes in the future. So that is that compromise position that we can utilize and facilitate and he concerns with that. I got none. So what I will do that is that when we prepare and have the documents moved forward on that basis we will ensure that David has that scope or Mr. King has that scope of responsibility. Thank you. All right. Any other questions at all? I see none. Then at this point here if I can ready to adjourn, I'm going to get a move on a seconder for adjournment. Melinda and Andy. And we will close at 151 PM. Thank you very much folks.", "summary": "**Part 1 Summary:**\n We're at the RMO Springfield. It's a question period.

This is a meeting for the Armors Springfield Special Meeting at Scuss are 25 financial plan. Today's date is April 29th at 2025 and the time is exactly 6pm. I'm Mayor Patrick Terram for the Armors Springfield. All accounts were present to my right. The sending order is a glad fuel and he is in ski. Mark Miller and Melinda Warren. If I can get a adoption of the agenda there, move on a second or please. Melinda and Glenn. In addition, from Council at all. I see an un- if I can get a mover or those in support of the adoption of the agenda. The second or for that is well-placed. We'll get into 4.1. That's adoption of the 2025 financial plan. I'm going to move on a second or for that as well please. Melinda and Patrick. The result that Council of the Armors Springfield adopt the 2025 financial plan consisting of one an operating budget to a capital budget. Three an estimate of operating revenue and expenditures for the following fiscal year and four a five-year capital expenditure program. Thank you questions. Councilor Miller. Now let's see. Oh, we can't hear. Unmute. Yeah. That work? Okay. Sorry about that. Just a couple of comments and questions. First one to the CO or CFO. Under section three point three zero four subsection one no later than May 15th of each year. This is the municipal act. After adopting its operating budget for the year, Council must buy bylaws set a rate of taxation. So I assume that in the next coming meetings we're going to have a bylaw to adopt the financial plan. Yeah. We pass a financial plan by resolution and then that becomes scheduled a to the bylaw for the taxation. Thank you for that clarity. A few concerns I have I wanted to share with Council with this particular proposed 2025 financial plan. I noted at least one resident got back to me actually there's a couple of them or few that had input questions to our council but as you know we don't have a question period we don't have delegations and we really have no mechanism for the public to engage with us. But this one individual is you know it's in our agenda kind of hidden from the public but this one individual did submit comments to the CCO and express that those comments be how can I say publicly known. So I'm just wondering when people submit comments because again we've eliminated question period we don't really have delegations to this special meeting. So there's no opportunity for the public to engage with us at all but yet this individual took the effort to do I think a two or three page exposition or series of questions for the financial plan but yet when they submitted them online this individual had the understanding that they would be posted publicly for people to share his concerns or maybe even respond to them but I think you know who I'm referring to I'm not sure if that individual wants me to say that their name but I'm just wondering when people submit comments wasn't that supposed to be the mechanism where the public still has the opportunity to publicly have their concerns shared with the community. In other words are we just now relying on OPEC, Ranton, Rave for the community to engage with us? This seems to be really the only mechanism I'm kind of frustrated at that because people are now calling me and saying mark other than you expressing our concerns at these meetings there's no ability for the public to engage with not only the bureaucracy but with council in general and so for some council members they feel it's gone on deaf years in other words they share those concerns with council representatives but they don't bring them up they don't share them and they don't respond to them and so they feel very frustrated they feel that the only mechanism now the only mechanism they have now are two things one two institute recall legislation which of course won't happen very quickly and the second is to vote differently at the next election in October of 2026 so it's unfortunate we've come to this situation where the public really is relegated to the backwards and and so my next point is with the provincial reassessment this year in 2025 we have an addition of two million dollars to our kitty and so we've taken upon us to find ways to spend that two million dollars and you know I came to council here wanting to sharpen my pencil as much as I could not to cut indiscriminately but to save tax peers dollars on discretionary items in other words things that are not necessarily for the clear benefit of the ratepayers of our community and I've tried to do that but like in any democracy if they don't flow with the rest of those who vote for those things they end up in in the dungeon and don't get past so I would suggest I would suggest that you know with this proposed budget I personally have seen that I'm going to have an 18% increase in my municipal taxes 18% and I don't have the biggest house in our municipality I guarantee that my neighbor across the street has a house worth at least five times mine and they're going to go ballistic if they're rate increases 18%. I know that's not the average but some people are going to have 20% some are going to have 2% some are going to have 8% they're going to wonder and ask us the question where are we spending this money why is we got two million dollars extra because of the reassessment but yet we're spending that like I want to be cautious when I say but we're spending it just because we have it and so we've got some very important and critical projects coming forward as we all know and we have to address those so I would like our council to set a goal of reducing expenditure is going forward not increasing them just because we have a an influx of two million dollars because next year we're not going to have that two million dollar extra kitty and if our expenses keep rising the way they are you know people are stretched to the limit we saw it in the election yesterday affordability and cost-eliming is the top priority for all political parties whether they really address it or not that's another issue but we have to on the grassroots here in the municipality realize that people don't have an endless credit card to spend money with they're I'm not going to go on a rant here but anyway you kind of get the adjust of where I'm going thank you thank you council similar I just want to remind people in the audience that there's no recording allowed there's a bit of an understand that thank you any other questions from council council council casinski yeah thank you I would like to point out council a matter that it's not $2 million but it's $3.2 million dollars we're going to receive from that 18% increase by a reassessment of how is this 3.3 council or casinski 3.3 okay that even all that even better yet so I will yeah echo your your comments and you concerned that you know we have to be really you know frogger with their money right now so because not gonna happen all the time that we're gonna get that reassessment because province have to you know realize that people only have so much money to spend and the gravy train gonna be over shortly so that's my concern and my input thank you thank you very much council council I just like to clarify or summarize everything that as the chair allows me this opportunity to do so the mechanisms for this budget were totally complied with there we did have our planning hearing or the the public hearing there last week I believe there and all the questions were answered I know who you were talking to and I don't know whether you mentioned his name and on I'm not sure whether I can or not but I won't and those questions were answered by me through on the record there so they're like I think they were referred to as flags or something like that so I answered all those questions there and the it was the questions were answered by or the answers were provided by a administration that weren't answered at the time of the hearing itself there so I do understand the situation that both councilors were talking about because of Kizinski Miller and we I I totally understand you know I don't know that our Amazon is as a strong position as ourselves we have a very good financial position there and it shows in the progress the steps that we're taking but we don't take it furiously we went through each one of these as you know through our committee of the holes and working groups there we went detail by detail line by line and and saved where we can and you know the wants as opposed to needs we're all we are all they're all weighed so we really quite heavily on our other directors for their budgets we give them something at the beginning of the year and for the everybody does the exceptional job with that money and they know what's the tax payers money it's most of them are the tax payers with any armors to make for themselves so the the increase as councilor Miller it's as stated they forget what councilor Miller was saying for his increase so there whether you said it or not I'm not sure but mine went up 21% of course I'm going to be paying a price for that my neighbors we've had discussions about that and you know unfortunately that's out of our control with the assessment year being this year yes we got a pretty good amount of money we got a pretty good amount of money two years ago I think we got 2.2 million two years ago things changed and so on like that so we we we we're able to reduce our excuse me or mill rate by 3.1 per six excuse me friend reduce it 3.1 six so it's not going to help a lot of the taxpayers there and that's on average of 17% increase within the armors springfield some you know might even pay a little bit less there but it's going as high as 21% and that that will be myself and my neighbors around me there so I I do understand the concerns from councilors Miller Kizinski there and just to reiterate there everybody does have an input into the into this the budget and that was expressed quite eloquently by several people there that came up to us last week as well as as time goes on there everybody has a chance to to discuss this through delegations and the questions through their counselors myself and I answer every every question there but that's all I have to say to summarize all that and the other questions from council to councilor Kizinski and I'm going to say that we did a really good job in working through this budget and we like I said it I said it time before that we went through this budget and went and reduced the mill rate once went back the second time and even became lower the second time and again all administration put their hearts into this to make it work and I agree that all administration and staff that are involved in the budget take it seriously with every residence dollar and they do the best they can and costs are going up wherever we look and we know that and we're doing the best we can so this budget to me is a good budget and we got a plan for the future and that's what we're doing because these costs and everything is not going down to keep going up thank you you councilor Miller thank you mr. Mayor it's good we have a council because we have different voice of you I wouldn't necessarily agree with the deputy mayor in this particular situation I think we can do better I think at eight or 17% average increase of the public knew that they would go ballistic they would not be embracing us in fact they would be very upset and they would be saying you ought to look wine by line one more time one sober second thought because despite cost going up and we can use that excuse everybody seems to but in all the reality uh manatovens aren't getting paid that much more and we're getting squeezed right to the you know the nines and so I think there is improvement to make and I cannot support this budget proposed as it is because I think we can use the excuse that the people had an opportunity for a public open house but again if we put it back if we put up the information very clearly that it was going to lead to a 17% increase I think you'd have this room packed and packed and packed because people are fed up and aren't going to put up with this anymore and we'll see it in October of 26. Thank you councilor does any other questions I see none we can read the resolution we can vote on it yes please the years all the council of the arm springfield adopt the 2025 financial plan consisting of one an operating budget to a capital budget three an estimate of operating revenue and expenditures for the following fiscal year and four a five-year capital expenditure program with the show hands first those in support that will be councilor one the premier fuel and the mayoritarian those opposed councilors Miller and Kazinsky the soul passed and this is any other questions from council I see none then proposed to adjourn can get a mover to second or two adjourn a councilor Melinda and Melinda Warren and the deputy mayor of fuel and at a 1617 p.m. the meeting is adjourned thank you very much people for attending in the audience and online and the council's", "summary": "**Part 1 Summary:**\n Let's start again. Now let's see. So I'm just wondering when people submit comments because again we've eliminated question period we don't really have delegations to this special meeting\n\n**Part 2 Summary:**\nIn other words are we just now relying on OPEC, Ranton, Rave for the community to engage with us? This seems to be really the only mechanism I'm kind of frustrated at that because people are now calling me and saying mark other than you expressing our concerns at these meetings there's no ability for the public to engage with not only the bureaucracy but with council in general and so for some council members they feel it's gone on deaf years in other words they share those concerns with council representatives but they don't bring them up they don't share them and they don't respond to them and so they feel very frustrated they feel that the only mechanism now the only mechanism they have now are two things one two institute recall legislation which of course won't happen very quickly and the second is to vote differently at the next election in October of 2026 so it's unfortunate we've come to this situation where the public really is relegated to the backwards and and so my next point is with the provincial reassessment this year in 2025 we have an addition of two million dollars to our kitty and so we've taken upon us to find ways to spend that two million dollars and you know I came to council here wanting to sharpen my pencil as much as I could not to cut indiscriminately but to save tax peers dollars on discretionary items in other words things that are not necessarily for the clear benefit of the ratepayers of our community and I've tried to do that but like in any democracy if they don't flow with the rest of those who vote for those things they end up in in the dungeon and don't get past so I would suggest I would suggest that you know with this proposed budget I personally have seen that I'm going to have an 18% increase in my municipal taxes 18% and I don't have the biggest house in our municipality I guarantee that my neighbor across the street has a house worth at least five times mine and they're going to go ballistic if they're rate increases 18%. \n\n**Part 3 Summary:**\nI know that's not the average but some people are going to have 20% some are going to have 2% some are going to have 8% they're going to wonder and ask us the question where are we spending this money why is we got two million dollars extra because of the reassessment but yet we're spending that like I want to be cautious when I say but we're spending it just because we have it and so we've got some very important and critical projects coming forward as we all know and we have to address those so I would like our council to set a goal of reducing expenditure is going forward not increasing them just because we have a an influx of two million dollars because next year we're not going to have that two million dollar extra kitty and if our expenses keep rising the way they are you know people are stretched to the limit we saw it in the election yesterday affordability and cost-eliming is the top priority for all political parties whether they really address it or not that's another issue but we have to on the grassroots here in the municipality realize that people don't have an endless credit card to spend money with they're I'm not going to go on a rant here but anyway you kind of get the adjust of where I'm going thank you thank you council similar I just want to remind people in the audience that there's no recording allowed there's a bit of an understand that thank you any other questions from council council council casinski yeah thank you I would like to point out council a matter that it's not $2 million but it's $3.2 million dollars we're going to receive from that 18% increase by a reassessment of how is this 3.3 council or casinski 3.3 okay that even all that even better yet so I will yeah echo your your comments and you concerned that you know we have to be really you know frogger with their money right now so because not gonna happen all the time that we're gonna get that reassessment because province have to you know realize that people only have so much money to spend and the gravy train gonna be over shortly so that's my concern and my input thank you thank you very much council council I just like to clarify or summarize everything that as the chair allows me this opportunity to do so the mechanisms for this budget were totally complied with there we did have our planning hearing or the the public hearing there last week I believe there and all the questions were answered I know who you were talking to and I don't know whether you mentioned his name and on I'm not sure whether I can or not but I won't and those questions were answered by me through on the record there so they're like I think they were referred to as flags or something like that so I answered all those questions there and the it was the questions were answered by or the answers were provided by a administration that weren't answered at the time of the hearing itself there so I do understand the situation that both councilors were talking about because of Kizinski Miller and we I I totally understand you know I don't know that our Amazon is as a strong position as ourselves we have a very good financial position there and it shows in the progress the steps that we're taking but we don't take it furiously we went through each one of these as you know through our committee of the holes and working groups there we went detail by detail line by line and and saved where we can and you know the wants as opposed to needs we're all we are all they're all weighed so we really quite heavily on our other directors for their budgets we give them something at the beginning of the year and for the everybody does the exceptional job with that money and they know what's the tax payers money it's most of them are the tax payers with any armors to make for themselves so the the increase as councilor Miller it's as stated they forget what councilor Miller was saying for his increase so there whether you said it or not I'm not sure but mine went up 21% of course I'm going to be paying a price for that my neighbors we've had discussions about that and you know unfortunately that's out of our control with the assessment year being this year yes we got a pretty good amount of money we got a pretty good amount of money two years ago I think we got 2.2 million two years ago things changed and so on like that so we we we we're able to reduce our excuse me or mill rate by 3.1 per six excuse me friend reduce it 3.1 six so it's not going to help a lot of the taxpayers there and that's on average of 17% increase within the armors springfield some you know might even pay a little bit less there but it's going as high as 21% and that that will be myself and my neighbors around me there so I I do understand the concerns from councilors Miller Kizinski there and just to reiterate there everybody does have an input into the into this the budget and that was expressed quite eloquently by several people there that came up to us last week as well as as time goes on there everybody has a chance to to discuss this through delegations and the questions through their counselors myself and I answer every every question there but that's all I have to say to summarize all that and the

and we're doing the best we can so this budget to me is a good budget and we got a plan for the future and that's what we're doing because these costs and everything is not going down to keep going up thank you you councilor Miller thank you mr. \n\n**Part 4 Summary:**\nMayor it's good we have a council because we have different voice of you I wouldn't necessarily agree with the deputy mayor in this particular situation I think we can do better I think at eight or 17% average increase of the public knew that they would go ballistic they would not be embracing us in fact they would be very upset and they would be saying you ought to look wine by line one more time one sober second thought because despite cost going up and we can use that excuse everybody seems to but in all the reality uh manatovens aren't getting paid that much more and we're getting squeezed right to the you know the nines and so I think there is improvement to make and I cannot support this budget proposed as it is because I think we can use the excuse that the people had an opportunity for a public open house but again if we put it back if we put up the information very clearly that it was going to lead to a 17% increase I think you'd have this room packed and packed and packed because people are fed up and aren't going to put up with this anymore and we'll see it in October of 26. Thank you councilor does any other questions I see none we can read the resolution we can vote on it yes please the years all the council of the arm springfield adopt the 2025 financial plan consisting of one an operating budget to a capital budget three an estimate of operating revenue and expenditures for the following fiscal year and four a five-year capital expenditure program with the show hands first those in support that will be councilor one the premier fuel and the mayoritarian those opposed councilors Miller and Kazinsky the soul passed and this is any other questions from council I see none then proposed to adjourn can get a mover to second or two adjourn a councilor Melinda and Melinda Warren and the deputy mayor of fuel and at a 1617 p.m. the meeting is adjourned thank you very much people for attending in the audience and online and the council's.
